YUG_DESC;Already during World War One in 1917 the founding of a south Slavic state was agreed upon. However Croats Montenegrinians and Slovenians only accepted Alexander I as ruler of the 'Kingdom of the Serbs Croats and Slovenians' under the pressure of Italian threats of annexion. The first constitution of 1921 laid down Serbian predominance so that the various religions and state traditions doomed the first Yugoslavian state. The Croat Farmers' Party boycotted the parliament in Belgrade and demanded a federalisation. Even their inclusion in the government of Nikola Pasic in 1925 could not overcome the differences. In 1928 Stefan Radic and two more delegates of the Farmers' Party were assassinated by a Montenegrinian representative of the Serbian Radical People's Party. King Alexander I suspended the constitution and and introduced a monarchical dictatorship in 1929 that was to enforce integration top down. The renaming of the kingdom into Yugoslavia and the establishment of geographically defined administrative entities (Banats) helped little as the Serbs continued to dominate the political life and as the Croats took radical measures founding the ultra-national Ustasha in 1929. The assassination of King Alexander I in 1934 brought the fragile country to the brink of civil war.;;;;;;;;;;x

YEM_DESC;The distance to the seat of the Caliph in Damascus (661) and later in Baghdad (762) provided Yemen in the Arab-Muslim world with a role on the rim. In 822 Yemen began breaking away from the Abbasides Caliphate declaring independence in 945. From there on the northern and southern Yemen began moving apart from each other. The reasons were in part geographical and economical - mountains and agriculture in the north sea trade in the south. Additionally religious and strategic-political issues played a role. In the north Shiites dominated in the south Sunnites. Foreign attempts of taking influence were focused on the strategically more important south with Britain eventually conquering Aden in 1839. The north was left in peace for the most part until the Ottoman Empire took the coast of North Yemen in 1849 and the highlands in 1872 with approval from the British who were intent on containing French expansion on the Red Sea. After World war One and the breaking up of the Ottoman Empire Northern Yemen declared its independence in 1918. The land was ruled by an Imam spiritual and secular leader in one. In 1934 the opposition of the Free Yemenites was formed who would in future become more and more radical.;;;;;;;;;;X

VEN_DESC;After 1830 a number of civil wars between conservatives and liberals rocked the country. In 1864 this period came to an end with the federalisation of the country and the proclamation of the Estados Unidos de Venezuela (United States of Venezuela). Only the dictatorship of General Antonio Guzm�n Blancos (1870 - 1887) consolidated the situation. After a few civilian presidents new military dictatorships follow. General Cipriano Castro (1899 - 1908) undertook assaults on foreign economic interests in his country eventually leading to the blocking of Venezuelan ports by German British and Italian ships. In 1904 the U.S.A. mediated a settlement of the conflict. Economically the the abolishment of slavery in 1854 led to decreasing agricultural production. The breakthrough to make Venezuela one of Latin America's leading economic powers was made however when at the end of 19th century petroleum deposits were discovered allowing the industrialisation of the agricultural state. Under General Juan Vicente G�mez (1908 - 1929 1931 - 1935) oil production became the economic foundation of Colombia (aided by foreign capital). The country having remained neutral during World War One was able to reduce the state's debts and to stabilise the currency.;;;;;;;;;;x

USA_DESC;In 1900 America was not yet considered one of the world's principal leading nations and its diplomacy was of limited importance in the affairs of the Great Powers. The crucial intervention of the United States on the Allied side in 1917 changed this forever: America became one of the key players in international finance and politics and its seemingly inexhaustible resources of labour industry and raw materials dwarfed those of the battered European states. But Americans retreated into diplomatic isolation after the ending of hostilities and their economic pre-eminence was rudely cut short by the 1929 Wall Street Crash and the ensuing Great Depression which with its epicentre in the New York stock markets hit the USA hardest of all. President Roosevelt's 1933 'New Deal' sought to reverse the nation's deep malaise and has by 1936 achieved some success. But Roosevelt is growing ever more concerned about the threat to democracy from the resurgent fascist states of Europe and the military extremists of Japan. His problem lies in the clear unwillingness of the American public to countenance any foreign  expeditions even with the best of motives. Can FDR aid Britain and France while holding his divided people together?;;;;;;;;;;X
USA_41_DESC;Few countries were less keen on entering the general European war than the United States in 1939. Two decades of isolationism had confirmed the population's broad belief that British French and German events were none of their affair: and even the shocking Nazi successes in the summer of 1940 only stirred a minority into demanding more aid for the democratic West. President Roosevelt eager to assist the British in their fight against Hitler but hamstrung by his country's unwillingness to become too involved used a number of ingenious ploys to get practical assistance such as 'Lend-Lease' to the UK: and in readiness for a possible American intervention in the future he began the build-up of the United States' modest and poorly equipped military forces. Throughout 1941 tensions in the North Atlantic over attacks on American naval vessels escorting Allied merchantmen pushed the US and Germany further towards the brink. When the decisive moment came however it was on the other side of the globe and from a very different enemy. Japan's surprise attack on the Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbour stunned America and although the damage done to American arms was ultimately not that severe the psychological blow it dealt to US self-assurance was devastating. Germany's equally surprise declaration of war a few days later confirmed America's place in the now-global war. President Roosevelt's immediate task is to prop up Allied defences in the threatened SE Asian theatre while getting as much aid to the beleaguered Russians and British as possible and at the same time creating a mighty American war machine that can intervene decisively both in Europe and across the Pacific.;;;;;;;;;;x

URU_DESC;Under President Jos� Batlle y Ordonez Uruguay saw its first era of stability. In two terms as president (1903 - 1907 1911 - 1915) he enacted economic and social reforms seperated state and church and took steps towards a moderate state socialism. The constitution of 1919 ruled the joint government of president and state council. A system taking that of Switzerland as an example and representing the losing parties in the government along with an exemplary social legislature and the economic prosperity made Uruguay one of the most liberal and domestically stable states of Latin America. The Great Depression 1929/30 hit Uruguay hard. Gabriel Terra seized the chance to establish a dictatorship by disbanding the state council in favour of an authoritarian system of government.;;;;;;;;;;x

TUTORIAL_6_A12_NAME;Supplying your troops;;;;;;;;;;X
TUTORIAL_6_A12_DESC;The part of your industrial capacity that you allocate to supplies is what keeps your armed forces supplied and in fighting condition. In order for troops in occupied territory to get supplies, there must be an unbroken chain of provinces under your control, from the province they are in back to your country. If not, supplies start running out, motorized units won't be able to move, all units will fight worse and eventually be decimated or surrender.;;;;;;;;;;X
TUTORIAL_6_A11_NAME;Occupying territory;;;;;;;;;;X

TUR_DESC;Following World War One the territory of the defeated Ottoman Empire had been reduced to Anatolia in the peace treaty of S�vres 1920. Mustafa Kemal organised the national resistance against foreign invaders bringing about a major victory over the Greek in 1922 after which the Peace of S�vres was revised and Turkey was granted control of the (de-militarised) Bosporus. After the last Sultan had been deposed and the capital had been moved to Ankara the Republic of Turkey was proclaimed on October 29th 1923. Kemal who would begin calling himself Atat�rk (Father of the Turks) from 1934 on began a cultural reform moving towards nationalist instead of religious ideals and abolishing the Caliphate in 1924. A year later a Kurdish uprising was brutally suppressed and Kemal disposed of all dangerous opposition during that time. Kemal's reforms were aimed at removing the old elite and patterns of power. Islam was no longer state religion by constitution the Latin alphabet was introduced as well as the international calendar and time system. A code of laws was patterned after the Swiss civil law and the traditional Fez was no longer allowed to be worn. Economically the young state focused on industrialisation and the building up of a decent infrastructure. When the Great Depression caused an agricultural crisis in Turkey in 1929 Kemal steered a course self-sufficiency. In 1934 the first Five Year Plan introduced the era of planned economy. At first the young republic found a good friend in the Soviet Union who had been the only country to support the Anatolian independence movement.;;;;;;;;;;x
TUR_41_DESC;That changed, however, when in October 1939 a mutual assistance pact was signed with France and England which would spoil the friendly relations to the Soviet Union forever. When France was occupied in 1940 and Italy joined the war Turkey decided to stay neutral. In 1941 Hitler had conquered the Balkans and the agreement of Ankara to remain neutral secured Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union on that front. In June 1941 the non-aggression pact between Turkey and Germany was signed.;;;;;;;;;;x

However when Turkey was allowed by international law to fortify the Bosporus and the Dardanelles the Western powers became more important especially Great Britain. Nevertheless an independent foreign policy remained a main goal for Kemal Atat�rk. After the death of Atat�rk in 1938 Ismet In�n� became president. During the politcal crisis that kept growing Ankara remained neutral keeping an equal distance to both London and Berlin.;;;;;;;;;;x

TIB_DESC;The Manchus who conquered China and established the Qing dynasty in the seventeenth century embraced Tibetan Buddhism as the Mongols had and developed close ties with the Tibetans. The Dalai Lama who had by then become the spiritual and temporal ruler of Tibet agreed to become the spiritual guide of the Manchu emperor. He accepted patronage and protection in exchange. This   priest-patron   relationship which the Dalai Lama also maintained with numerous Mongol Khans and Tibetan nobles was the only formal tie that existed between the Tibetans and Manchus during the Qing dynasty. It did not in itself affect Tibet`s independence. On the political level some powerful Manchu emperors succeeded in exerting a degree of influence over Tibet. Thus between I720 and I792 the Manchu emperors Kangxi Yong Zhen and Qianlong sent imperial troops into Tibet four times to protect the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan people from foreign invasion or internal unrest. It was these expeditions that provided them with influence in Tibet. The emperor sent representatives to the Tibetan capital Lhasa some of whom successfully exercised their influence in his name over the Tibetan government particularly with respect to the conduct of foreign relations. At the height of Manchu power which lasted a few decades the situation was not unlike that which can exist between a superpower and a neighboring satellite or protectorate. The subjection of a state to foreign influence and even intervention in foreign or domestic affairs however significant this may be politically does not in itself entail the legal extinction of that state. Consequently although some Manchu emperors exerted considerable influence over Tibet they did not thereby incorporate Tibet into their empire much less China. Manchu influence did not last for very long. It was entirely ineffective by the time the British briefly invaded Tibet in 1904 and ceased entirely with the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in 1911 and its replacement in China by a native republican government. Whatever ties existed between the Dalai Lama and the Qing emperor were extinguished with the dissolution of the Manchu Empire. From 1911 on Tibet successfully avoided undue foreign influence and behaved in every respect as a fully independent state. The 13th Dalai Lama emphasized his country's independent status externally in formal communications to foreign rulers and internally by issuing a proclamation reaffirming Tibet's independence and by strengthening the country's defences. The attitude of most foreign governments with whom Tibet maintained relations implied their recognition of Tibet's independent status. The British government bound itself not to recognise Chinese suzerainty or any other rights over Tibet unless China signed the draft Simla Convention of 1914 with Britain and Tibet which China never did.;;;;;;;;;;X

TECH_SUB_NAME;Submarine Research;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_SUB_DESC;This field of research allows a nation to develop a submarine force. This force can be critical if the war effort relies on denying the enemy the ability to ship troops and supplies across the ocean. The submarines are very effective in patrolling vast sea lanes for enemy shipping and sinking it. This field of research also allows anti-submarine warfare (ASW) equipment and technologies to be developed.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_ROCKET_NAME;Rocketry Research;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_ROCKET_DESC;This field of research allows a nation to develop rocket weapons that can strike at the enemy from a great distance. These weapons were fairly primitive at the time, but if researched intensively and produced in great numbers they can be a tremendous weapon against the enemy. These weapons could also be used as carriers for nuclear weapons if a nation were to develop them.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_REQUIRED;Required for %s.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_REQ;Requires:;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_NUCLEAR_NAME;Nuclear Research;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_NUCLEAR_DESC;This field of research allows a nation to develop nuclear weapons and power plants. The weapons can be used against the enemy with a tremendous destructive and morale effect. Power plants can be used to power submarines and surface warships. But this field of research is very costly and also very unreliable. Vast resources can be put into this research but there are no guarantees of successful results or payoffs.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_NAVAL_NAME;Naval Research;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_NAVAL_DOC_NAME;Naval Warfare Doctrines;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_NAVAL_DOC_DESC;A military doctrine can be described as a paradigmatic solution to certain formulated problems of war. It defines the goal, the means and the operational procedures of the combat, the doctrine may define these issues in the scope of strategic, operational and tactical operations. The field of doctrines is at least as important as a nation's gains in technological research. A navy equipped with the latest ships will be defeated by an enemy with a more advanced doctrinal approach to combat.;;;;;;;;;;x
TECH_NAVAL_DESC;This field of research allows a nation to develop a naval power projection capability. If your war effort relies either upon controlling the enemy by projecting your own power over the sea, or by denying the enemy the ability to project his own power, this field is vital. Research will allow a nation to build capital ships such as Battleships and Air Carriers as well as convoys and their escorts shipping supplies across the ocean. Another important aspect of this field of research is the amphibious warfare capability that can be developed.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_9_NAME;Refined Equipment and Countermeasures;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_9_DESC;As the fruits of your technological knowledge have given birth to new behemoths of war the same can be said about the enemy. Tactics and operational use have proven that some small redesign and improvement must be made if you want to win the war. Torpedoes, fire-control systems, radar warning systems and anti-radar rubber coating are all to your benefit.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_8_NAME;Advanced Submarine Construction;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_8_DESC;By engaging in research in this field your country will learn how to produce Electro Submarines with higher speed and firepower than the older Long-Range Submarines. The Electro Submarines are able to contest the sea power of the enemy virtually without being detected.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_7_NAME;Advanced Weaponry and Detection;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_7_DESC;It is again time to upgrade your vehicles of war with grand new equipment. Let your achievements in other fields of research be put to good use. Torpedoes, fire-control systems, radar warning systems and minisubs all improve your fighting power.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_6_NAME;Long Range Naval Recon Aircraft;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_6_DESC;This research project means designing and modifying aircraft for the use of supporting submarine operations. It also means that you must divert resources to get the Naval Aviation to start working for the Submarine arm, a costly affair. The various aircraft you research are governed abstractly and its impact on the game is seen as increases in Submarine stats.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_5_NAME;Improved Submarine Construction ;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_5_DESC;By engaging in research in this field, your country will learn how to produce Long-Range Submarines of a higher quality and stamina than the older Medium Range Submarines. The Long-Range Submarines are able to contest the sea power of the enemy from Kiel to New York or from Los Angeles to Yokohama.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_4_NAME;Improved Weaponry and Detection;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_4_DESC;At this point you have either constructed a new type of submarine or you are satisfied with the one you already have. It is time to upgrade your vehicles of war with new equipment. Torpedoes, fire-control systems, sonar and long-range radios all improve your fighting power.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_3_NAME;Equipment Trials and Testing;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_3_DESC;You have now gained enough knowledge in the field of submarine technology that you can start some basic research projects. The applications found here allow you produce very advanced equipment later on. If you have not researched them, your technological advance in this field will be halted.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_2_NAME;Small Submarine Development;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_2_DESC;At this point you may research into very small auxiliary underwater vessels such as mini-submarines and torpedoes.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_12_NAME;Nuclear Submarine Propulsion;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_12_DESC;In the field of Nuclear technology you have designed a propulsion system based on a small nuclear reactor, an old dream of submariners can be fulfilled, unlimited range and high underwater speed. The problem is making the reactor small enough and to secure it safely so that the crew will not be affected by radiation.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_11_NAME;Semi-Modern Equipment and Countermeasures;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_11_DESC;As the fruits of your technological knowledge have given birth to new behemoths of war the same can be said about the enemy. Tactics and operational use have proven that some small redesign and improvement must be made if you want to win the war. Your talented scientists might improve your submarines and torpedoes so that you can seek the destruction of the enemy without detection.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_10_NAME;Special Vehicles and Detection Systems;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_10_DESC;At this point your research in other fields together with your exploitations in Submarine technology may give you some exceptional special vehicles such as Submarine Aircraft Carriers and Advanced Minisubs, but also state-of-the-art sonar and radar warning systems.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_1_NAME;Basic Submarine Construction;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_1_DESC;By engaging in research in this project your country will learn how to produce Medium Range Submarines of a higher quality and stamina than the older Coastal Submarines. The Medium Range Submarines are able to contest the sea power of the enemy in the unprotected areas of his sea-lanes.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_9_NAME;Nuclear Delivery Vehicles;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_9_DESC;At this point you may modify the Flying Bomb and the Flying Rocket to carry a nuclear warhead instead of a conventional one. In order to be able to go from theoretical to applied knowledge you must have first researched nuclear technology.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_8_NAME;Advanced Rocket and Jet Design;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_8_DESC;At this point you have the theoretical, and hopefully, the applied research to deepen your knowledge in the field of rocketry, thereby upgrading your weaponry by applied science. This research will allow the development of the turbojet engine for better aircraft, offensive and defensive missiles increasing the combat values of aircraft and upgrading air-defence systems with missiles.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_7_NAME;Flying Rocket Development ;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_7_DESC;This is the final test and development phase to convert a good prototype into a version for serial-production. This research will enable the Flying Rocket and the Multistage Rocket to be built.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_6_NAME;Flying Bomb Development;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_6_DESC;This is the final test and development phase to convert a good prototype into a version for serial-production. This research will enable the Flying Bomb.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_5_NAME;Flying Bomb and Rocket Testing ;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_5_DESC;This is one of the most time and resource intensive pieces of research that must take place in order to attain the great vehicles of destruction. The launch procedure must be perfected and trajectory test flights made to check real problems concerning these flying bombs and rockets. Research can also go into letting rockets launch from aircraft or ships.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_4_NAME;Jet Engine Design;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_4_DESC;Four different methods seemed possible at the time. In order of design complexity they were the solid-fuel rocket, the liquid-fuel rocket, the ramjet and the turbojet. All of these provided forward thrust by constant recoil verses the propeller, which literally drags a vehicle through the air.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_3_NAME;Improved Rocket Design;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_3_DESC;With the Military Test and Research Facilities and the insights into basic rocket design, the next step in the project is to broaden and deepen it in quality. It will enable research into a new type of rocket fuel, a miniature steam engine for launch equipment and a basic autopilot to guide larger rockets to their targets.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_2_NAME;Military Test and Research Facility;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_2_DESC;Rocket Test and Research Facilities were found in most major countries during the war. But only nations with Military Test and Research Facilities could produce military applications in the field of rocketry. Therefore, it is essential to build these facilities in order to benefit from the research.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_12_NAME;ICBM Development;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_12_DESC;The last step to the ultimate power in the modern era is the development of the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM), which can reach the most remote places on earth. Armed with a nuclear warhead it constitutes the weapon of ultimate destruction. By refining research into the Ballistic Missile with understandings of multi-stage rocketry it is ultimately possible to construct silo-based ICBMs.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_11_NAME;Ballistic Missile Development;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_11_DESC;With the knowledge and usage of large rockets as vehicles of war comes a wish to increase operational range and accuracy to hit the target. Introducing rockets of even larger proportions can do this and if range and accuracy are good enough, then these improved flying rockets are called Ballistic Missiles. It is now possible to test and develop a very large rocket and a new computerized launch and guidance system, which will allow the Ballistic Missile.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_10_NAME;Mobile Launch Sites;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_10_DESC;Historically the static nature of large rocket systems originates from the lack of adequate electronic and hydraulic equipment. Basically the Flying Bombs and Rockets were launched from static positions. Efforts were put into making them as transportable as possible, mainly by using a large vehicle that moved rather quickly as they were at the same time large enough to launch from.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_1_NAME;Basic Rocket Design;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_1_DESC;The first step in this project is to make the most basic advancement into rocket fuel, ballistics and flight trajectories and some sort of guidance system. Once this has been achieved, you will have the technology to develop small rockets for prototype tests or for use as artillery or infantry support.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_9_NAME;Atomic Bomb Development;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_9_DESC;Developing the A-Bomb is like understanding fission in the laboratory, but now in a different environment. The bomb must be constructed correctly, it must detonate when and where you want it to, and the fission itself must be efficient enough. All this must be researched in both theory and practice.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_8_NAME;Nuclear Reactor Operability;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_8_DESC;One of the later phases of the Nuclear Project is to get your Nuclear Reactor going. For this you need both theoretical and practical technological knowledge. This theoretical research level makes you understand how it should be done and the applications let you try out your design. When all are researched you have an operating Nuclear Reactor, which produces bomb material.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_7_NAME;Nuclear Reactor Design;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_7_DESC;To continue down the road of Nuclear Power a functional reactor is everything. If you are not opting for a mere Thermal Diffusion Plant, then you need an experimental reactor which is then enlarged in steps until fission is powerful enough and of course, controlled. Now everything depends upon the original design and any flaws in it will take many years to correct. Even if the Thermal Diffusion Plant is your option you will need a good design, as that plant must produce vast amounts of below average bomb material.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_6_NAME;Nuclear Fuel and Bomb Material Analysis;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_6_DESC;The Isotope Separation Facility and the Betatron Particle Accelerator will now enable you to deepen your research into Nuclear Power, by analysing potential nuclear fuels and bomb materials.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_5_NAME;Isotope Separation Process;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_5_DESC;At this point a functional process for creating nuclear fuel (natural isotopes) and bomb material (artificial isotopes) must be established to be worked into a sustainable method.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_4_NAME;Chain Reaction Process Discovered;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_4_DESC;To be able to explore the promises of nuclear power one must first prove that the neutrons initiating fission of uranium reproduce themselves in the process and that therefore, a multiplying chain reaction might occur with explosive force.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_3_NAME;Laboratory Produced Fission;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_3_DESC;To start treading the unexplored path to nuclear power one must first create a process in which atomic nuclei are split into fragments with the release of an enormous amount of energy.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_2_NAME;Experimental Proof of the Equivalence of Mass and Energy ;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_2_DESC;To be able to unlock the secrets of nuclear power one must first prove that mass and energy are equivalent.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_12_NAME;Nuclear Power Production;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_12_DESC;At this point you can now research into nuclear power production technology and nuclear propulsion systems.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_11_NAME;Advanced Nuclear Research;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_11_DESC;By pressing even harder down the nuclear road you can now research into military special technology and advanced nuclear-related weaponry.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_10_NAME;Atomic Bomb Testing;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_10_DESC;The testing phase of the Nuclear Power project is the last one for true nuclear strike capability. By detonating at least one A-Bomb, but preferably more, in a rigged and scientifically controlled fashion, knowledge will be produced which will enable you to actually use your new weapons.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_1_NAME;Artificially Produced Radioactivity;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_1_DESC;To start researching nuclear power seriously, one must produce radioactive matter artificially by bombarding an atom and get its nucleus to capture the hitting neutron. The then unstable nucleus will emit an electron and become stable. Thus, the final, stable nucleus will be one unit higher in mass number and one unit higher in atomic number than the initial target nucleus. This finally provided the atoms and isotopes which are useful for nuclear research.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_DOC_6_NAME;Late War Combat Testing;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_DOC_6_DESC;Real life combat tested the strength of the doctrine. Good ones were refined, and bad ones were flushed out with the bathwater. This requires that the Naval Staff follows the development and combat of the navy very carefully. It also means a perpetual evaluation and elaboration of unit and sub-unit organization and operations. In this field issues of command, control, intelligence and logistics are important and can be improved upon.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_DOC_5_NAME;Late War Experience Analysis;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_DOC_5_DESC;These doctrines are developed from the experience drawn from the fighting late in the war. The lessons learned have led to a refinement of how combat operations should be conducted effectively.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_DOC_4_NAME;Early War Combat Testing;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_DOC_4_DESC;Real life combat tested the strength of the doctrine. Good ones were refined, and bad ones were flushed out with the bathwater. This requires that the Naval Staff follows the development and combat of the navy very carefully.

TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_DOC_3_NAME;Early War Experience Analysis;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_DOC_3_DESC;These doctrines are developed from the experience drawn from the fighting early in the war. The lessons learned have led to a refinement of how combat operations should be conducted effectively.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_DOC_2_NAME;Pre-War Field Testing;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_DOC_2_DESC;The doctrines developed must now be tested and put to practical use. This requires extensive field-testing and elaboration of unit and sub-unit organization and operations. In this field issues of command, control, intelligence and logistics are important and can be improved upon.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_DOC_1_NAME;Great War Analysis;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_DOC_1_DESC;These doctrines are developed from the experience drawn from World War I. The lessons learned in that war have led to a massive reconsideration of how combat operations should be conducted effectively.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_9_NAME;Advanced ASW and Convoy Escorts;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_9_DESC;As the threat of submarines disrupting supply convoys increased, so did the need for effective countermeasures. Within this field of research several effective submarine detection devices can be researched.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_8_NAME;Advanced Warship Design;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_8_DESC;The research into new hull-designs and propulsion systems, as well as the development of new weapons, will allow the construction of a new class of surface warships - the 'Advanced'-class. This ship class has better firepower, speed, manoeuvrability and survival than the previous 'Improved'-class.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_7_NAME;Improved ASW and Convoy Escorts;;;;;;;;;;X

TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_5_NAME;Basic ASW and Convoy Escorts;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_5_DESC;As the threat of submarines disrupting supply convoys increased, so did the need for effective countermeasures. Within this field of research several effective submarine detection devices can be researched.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_4_NAME;Improved Naval Armament;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_4_DESC;This project allows the research of armaments and armour for warships. The best armament and armour type will be added to any new warship built, but also speed and the cost of a warship will increase. Building warships was not be a cheap venture, many smaller nations nearly had to abolish their navies during the 30's and 40's as they could not keep up with the arms race.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_3_NAME;Amphibious Warfare;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_3_DESC;Amphibious Warfare allows a nation to project its land force across an ocean and strike at enemy territory. It is a vastly complex task to synchronize the shipment of men and materials to an enemy controlled beach and effectively conduct combat operations there to defeat the enemy. Once this art is mastered however, it can be tremendously effective.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_2_NAME;Basic Warship Design;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NAVAL_2_DESC;The research into new hull-designs and propulsion systems, as well as the development of new weapons, will allow the construction of a new class of surface warships - the 'Basic'-class.

TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_7_DESC;The introduction of the Heavy Tank onto the battlefield truly shifted the advantage from defensive infantry units to mechanized armoured units. They had a greater mobility and range then their predecessors, the Light Tank and the Medium Tank. They also had an impact on the morale of enemy forces as these behemoths were very difficult to defeat with anti-tank weapons.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_6_NAME;Armour Skirts;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_6_DESC;Armour Skirts were in reality large pieces of armour attached to the sides of a tank, covering parts of the hull structure and the tracks. The Armour skirts provided two advantages, firstly it protected the tracks that were easily destroyed by enemy fire, secondly it added armour protection to the entire tank, especially against High Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) projectiles.;;;;;;;;;;x
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_5_NAME;Sloped Armour;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_5_DESC;Sloped Armour had existed to some degree in armoured vehicles for many years. But not until World War II was it practically implemented in the overall design of tanks. The sloped armour increased the protection of armoured vehicles without adding actual armour and weight. Instead the sloping armour could redirect a projectile, allowing it to skid off the vehicle's hull.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_4_NAME;Assault Guns & Tank Destroyers;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_4_DESC;The improvements in tank design allowed the chassis to be used for other purposes. The Assault Gun was a tank chassis fitted with an Infantry Gun. The Assault Gun would cooperate with the infantry and aid in the destruction of hardened targets and function as direct fire support. The Tank Destroyer would likewise move with the infantry and destroy hardened targets, primarily armoured vehicles. The Assault Gun and the Tank Destroyer existed in both motorized infantry, mechanized and armoured units.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_3_NAME;Amphibious Tanks;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_3_DESC;The first amphibious tanks allowed the Marine Unit to pack a much heavier punch on the battlefield and the landing beach. It could move with the landing troops and aid in the destruction of defensive perimeters, bunkers and armoured vehicles. It gave the Marine Unit a greater versatility and function.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_2_NAME;Welded Armour;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_2_DESC;The first armoured vehicles with welded armour were made possible by better welding techniques. This allowed vehicles to be armoured to a much higher degree than previously, and this armour did not prove hazardous to the crew. It could theoretically be made as thick as the designers wanted, the limits were instead imposed by engine and suspension technology.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_12_NAME;Armoured Personnel Carriers;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_12_DESC;While troops had been given some degree of protection in various armoured troop carriers, they had always been limited in their function. All vehicles had been open-topped giving little or no protection against indirect fire. The Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC) allowed troops to move over the battlefield in a completely enclosed vehicle providing maximum protection. It also allowed them to move in close proximity to the tank troops.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_11_NAME;Super-Heavy Tanks;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_11_DESC;The Super-Heavy Tank was a tank of nothing but monstrous proportions. Modern Main Battle Tanks are small vehicles in comparison, regarding both size and weight. These tanks were to the scientists and designers of the time the next natural step in development after the Heavy Tank. The Super-Heavy Tank would have impenetrable armour and would thus roam the battlefield unchallenged.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_10_NAME;Infrared Gun Sights;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_10_DESC;The Infrared Gun Sight allowed a tank crew to illuminate their environment with an infrared light and obtain a picture through a receiver. Thus, a tank equipped with an infrared floodlight could allow its gunner to detect the enemy in the dark. The equipment was however vulnerable to the enemy if they were equipped with an infrared receiver/viewer which could very easily detect the emitter lamp used to illuminate the environment.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_1_NAME;Riveted Armour;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_1_DESC;The first armoured vehicles came into field service in World War I. These all had riveted armour. This armour, complemented with techniques of bolting, made for a less than perfect protection. When a vehicle with riveted bolted armour was hit by a heavy projectile its occupants risked being chopped alive by flying bolts and rivets. This was all the designers had to make do with since the welding techniques of the time did not allow for welded armour.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_AIR_DOC_6_NAME;Late War Combat Testing;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_AIR_DOC_6_DESC;Real life combat tested the strength of the doctrine. Good ones where refined, and bad ones where flushed out with the bathwater. This requires that the General Staff follows the development and combat of the army very carefully.

TECH_LEVEL_AIR_DOC_2_NAME;Pre-War Field Testing;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_AIR_DOC_2_DESC;The doctrines developed must now be tested and put to practical use. This requires extensive field-testing and elaboration of unit and sub-unit organization and operations. In this field issues of command, control, intelligence and logistics are important and can be improved upon.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_AIR_DOC_1_NAME;Great War Experience Analysis;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_AIR_DOC_1_DESC;These doctrines are developed from the experience drawn from World War I. The lessons learned in that war have led to a massive reconsideration of how combat operations should be conducted effectively.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LAND_DOC_NAME;Land Warfare Doctrines;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LAND_DOC_DESC;A military doctrine can be described as a school of theory on how combat is to be conducted. It defines the goal, the means and the operational procedures of the combat, the doctrine may define these issues in the scope of strategic, operational and tactical operations. The field of doctrines is at least as important as a nation's gains in technological research. An army equipped with the latest equipment will be defeated by an enemy with a more advanced doctrinal approach to combat. It is also very important for a nation to make decisions on whether to develop a defensive or offensive doctrine since it will be costly to maintain two doctrines.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_L_AIR_NAME;Light Aircraft Research;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_L_AIR_DESC;This field of research allows a nation to develop fighter aircraft. These fighters can be used to escort bombers and other heavy aircraft and ensure that they reach their targets. The fighters can also be used to defend friendly airspace against enemy intrusion. This is vital in order to protect a nation's industry, upon which the war effort relies.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_INFANTRY_NAME;Infantry Research;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_INFANTRY_DESC;This field of research allows a nation to develop weapons and materials for its infantry personnel. It includes hand-held weapons and special equipment allowing the construction of Marines and Paratroops.

TECH_INDUSTRY_DESC;;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_H_AIR_NAME;Heavy Aircraft Research;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_H_AIR_DESC;This field of research allows a nation to develop bombers and air transports. This field is vital for a nation that needs to strike at the enemy from a distance. Bombers are tremendously effective in destroying the enemy's industry and in crushing the morale of the enemy by bombing his population centres. Bombers however are heavy and slow, and need fighters to escort them and protect them against enemy fighters.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_ELECTRONICS_NAME;Electronics Research;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_ELECTRONICS_DESC;This field of research allows a nation to develop a multitude of not only important, but also necessary applications. Most importantly this field will lead to the development of the radar, which is vital to achieving success in the war. The research will also enable improved radio communications equipment. A nation will be able to develop coding machines and eventually general-purpose computers. These computers are vital for a nuclear research program.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_EFFECTS;Effects     [U] = on upgrade;;;;;;;;;;x
TECH_ARTILLERY_NAME;Artillery Research;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_ARTILLERY_DESC;This field of research allows a nation to develop artillery pieces of various configurations and functions. This field is critical as all other fields depend upon it.

The research leads to heavier and more lethal tanks and other armoured equipment. This field is critical for any nation that aspires to project its power through land force.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_9_4_NAME;Basic Anti-Radar Rubber Coating;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_9_4_DESC;This was a hull coating made of rubber and cement that significantly reduced the radar visibility of the submarine. Few submarines with coating ever operated during the war, but none of the ones that did were ever sunk.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_9_3_NAME;Advanced Radar Warning System;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_9_3_DESC;This device was an advanced Radar Warning System based on the centimetric system. Its primary use was to locate and warn the submarine of incoming aircraft or anti-submarine warfare vessels. It gave the submarine a forewarning which tended to compensate for the submarine's vulnerability when trying to evade an approaching enemy.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_9_2_NAME;Improved Torpedo-Pattern Apparatus;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_9_2_DESC;This device was attached to the head of the torpedo and made it run a wandering course with regular 180-degree turns. It was very successful against vessels that lacked manoeuvrability. The improved version was much more sophisticated and used more variable patterns. Historically this was the German LUT.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_9_1_NAME;Improved Acoustic Torpedo;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_9_1_DESC;At this point you can upgrade your basic acoustic torpedo by introducing a new homing device, which cannot yet be countered by enemy surface ships. It is also faster and more reliable than the former version. Historically this was the German T11 Zaunk�nig II.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_8_7_NAME;Improved Radar Warning System;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_8_7_DESC;This device was an improved Radar Warning System based on the centimetric system. Its primary use was to locate and warn the submarine of incoming aircraft or anti-submarine warfare vessels. It gave the submarine a forewarning which tended to compensate for the submarine's vulnerability when trying to evade an approaching enemy.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_8_6_NAME;Electro Submarine (Sub Model III);;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_8_6_DESC;These boats were the first of a new generation of attack submarines with outstanding range and staying power. They were popular with their crews and moved as fast under water as on the surface. They also had a much more powerful striking power than the Long Range Submarine thanks to their hydraulic reload system and due to the fact that they were both extremely easy to manoeuvre and very hard to detect. Historically this was the German Type XXI and the Japanese I-200 'Sen-taka'.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_8_5_NAME;Hydraulic Reload System;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_8_5_DESC;This means that the submarine is equipped with mechanical machinery for bringing a torpedo from storage into the firing position. With this application a submarine could reload 6 tubes in 10 minutes, the time it took to reload one tube for the old Long Range Submarine.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_8_4_NAME;Improved Schnorkel;;;;;;;;;;X

TECH_APP_SUB_8_2_NAME;Air Conditioning and Cooling System;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_8_2_DESC;The submariners living in cramped, moist coffins had long asked for such a system, but it was hard to accommodate with the technology of those days. However, when finally successful it vastly improved the durability of the crew and made them much more effective in combat.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_8_1_NAME;Closed Circle Engine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_8_1_DESC;Such an engine required no air intake and therefore could run when a submarine was submerged and at the same time offered enough power to achieve speeds of around 25 knots. This will vastly increase the speed and performance of the Electro Submarines, the best class of the war.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_7_5_NAME;Improved Minisubs;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_7_5_DESC;At this point you may upgrade to improved minisubs to use against the capital ships of your enemy. The minisub's extreme short range means that they will have to be based on battleships or aircraft carriers.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_7_4_NAME;Basic Radar Warning System;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_7_4_DESC;This device was the first Radar Warning System based on the centimetric system. Its primary use was to locate and warn the submarine of incoming aircraft or anti-submarine warfare vessels.

TECH_APP_SUB_7_1_DESC;Together with your exceptionally vast knowledge in the modern field of electronics you will now be able to research  the mysteries of the acoustic homing torpedo. This is the first such weapon but it is still a vast improvement over the conventional ones. Acoustic homing means that there is a small device in the torpedo that steers it towards the noisiest target. It is however sometimes troubled by the fact that sound devices of the state-of-the-art destroyers of the enemy can counter it. Historically this was the German T5 Zaunk�nig.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_6_5_NAME;VLR Naval Recon Aircraft;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_6_5_DESC;This aircraft has basically the same quality as the Improved Long-Range Naval Reconnaissance Aircraft, but it is has a very long range. If this aircraft is put to an efficient patrol route, vast oceans may be covered. Note that this will not give any actual units.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_6_4_NAME;Improved LR Naval Recon Aircraft;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_6_4_DESC;This improved aircraft will service the submarines in the same way as the Basic Long-Range Naval Reconnaissance Aircraft.

TECH_APP_SUB_5_6_NAME;Long Range Submarine (Sub Model II);;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_5_6_DESC;These boats were the second of a new generation of attack submarines with excellent range and staying power. They were popular with their crews and very agile on the surface, even if larger than the earlier type. They also had a much more powerful striking power than their smaller brothers due to a much larger storage capacity that made reloading of torpedoes much faster. Historically this was the German Type IX.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_5_5_NAME;Excellent Night Sights;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_5_5_DESC;Night Sights are extremely important for submarines, as it is harder for enemy anti-submarine warfare vessels to locate the submarine in darkness. This sight increases the performance of the submarine.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_5_4_NAME;Basic Schnorkel;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_5_4_DESC;By installing a simple pipe system, which enables a periscoping submarine to operate its diesels under water, your submarine will gain great stamina and speed. However this is still a basic version and thus, a bit fragile.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_5_3_NAME;Advanced Pressure Hull;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_5_3_DESC;This application will allow your Long-Range Submarines to dive deeper and stay under water for longer, a prerequisite for successfully attacking the convoys of the enemy.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_5_2_NAME;Advanced Torpedo Chambers;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_5_2_DESC;This application studies the design and construction of an advanced torpedo chamber that uses the available storage space in the submarine to a maximum. It must also be designed so that reloading will be a quick affair for your crews.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_5_1_NAME;Large Fuel Tank Design;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_5_1_DESC;At this point it is necessary to design large fuel tanks and at the same time keep the sea-worthiness of the boat intact. These new, large fuel tanks are needed if you are going to be able to build Long-Range Submarines.;;;;;;;;;;X

TECH_APP_SUB_4_1_NAME;Torpedo Data Computer;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_4_1_DESC;This application will allow you remove the old mechanical submarine torpedo director, which the British used to call 'The Fruit Machine', and instead introduce the TDC or the electro-mechanical Torpedo Data Computer which vastly enhances the capability to plot and follow the courses of many torpedoes at once and towards many targets. It will give your submarines a heavier punch.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_3_4_NAME;Schnorkel Testing;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_3_4_DESC;A surfaced submarine was propelled by its diesel engine, but often it had to dive and seek underwater-protection from anti-submarine warfare vessels and aircraft, at which point it was running on a limited electric motor which only managed a few knots and had very limited endurance. By installing a simple pipe system, which enabled a periscoping submarine to operate its diesels, the schnorkel thus gave it almost unlimited underwater range. This application will provide your scientists with the knowledge to install such a device later on.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_3_3_NAME;Streamlined Pressure Hulls Testing;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_3_3_DESC;At this point your scientists will start designing conventional pressure hulls in such a fashion that their streamlined feature makes the submarine less vulnerable to detection from enemy radars.

TECH_APP_SUB_3_1_DESC;One of the dreams of submariners is that of a submarine with an engine that would let it run as fast under water as over it. Such an engine required no air intake and therefore could run when a submarine was submerged and at the same time offered enough power to achieve speeds of around 25 knots. By starting out early and trying the concept out you may be able to build such submarines later on.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_2_3_NAME;Basic Minisubs;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_2_3_DESC;At this point you may start developing minisubs to use against the capital ships of your enemy. The minisubs' extreme short range means that they will have to be based on battleships or aircraft carriers.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_2_2_NAME;Small Underwater Vehicle Testing;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_2_2_DESC;This application allows you to test and try out man-operated underwater vehicles of very small size for further exploitation. It is a troublesome process to test hulls that must be both very small and be able to withstand high pressure.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_2_1_NAME;Basic Conventional Torpedo;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_2_1_DESC;This application will produce a conventional torpedo based upon the nautical technologic knowledge of the day.

TECH_APP_ROCKET_8_2_DESC;This means further testing, refinement and development of an Air-to-Air Missile (AAM) used by fighters against enemy bombers. It uses a liquid-fuel rocket engine and is equipped with a radar homing device and proximity fuse. Historically this was the German Ruhrstahl X-4.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_8_1_NAME;Turbojet Engine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_8_1_DESC;The Turbojet Engine is more complex than the Ramjet requiring a rapidly spinning compressor to push enough air into the combustion chamber so the engine can generate sufficient thrust. The biggest obstacle to realizing the dream of jet powered flight is in producing a compact turbojet that gives good thrust whilst standing up to extreme heat and vibration.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_6_NAME;Multi-Stage Rocket;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_6_DESC;The Multi-Stage Rocket is a weapon of approximately the same performance as the Flying Bomb. Its accuracy is slightly better, but its minuscule warhead of only 25 kilos prevents it from being an effective weapon of war. Instead it is developed for research into the mysteries of the future. Historically this was the German Rheinb�te Z-61.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_5_NAME;Spin Stabilization Corrections;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_5_DESC;The Multi-Stage Rocket does not have a guidance system as the Flying Bomb or the Flying Rocket, but instead its spin-stabilization, high velocity and good speed will ensure that it deviates very little from the target. However, it also means that the spin-stabilization must be perfect, a fact that must be ensured by corrections after the test flights.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_4_NAME;Multi-Stage Test Flights;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_4_DESC;The biggest problem with a Multi-Stage Rocket is of course the stages themselves. It is very important that they separate at the right moment and that they have had time to deliver all their thrusting power. This must now be calibrated in careful testing.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_3_NAME;Flying Rocket;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_3_DESC;The Flying Rocket is a fast, non-interceptable one-shot bomber unit with a low attack value of 1 ton of TNT. Its rather poor accuracy will only allow it to conduct Terror Bombing missions. Its movement is a bit peculiar. In controlled territory it uses extremely slow land movement. When it is ordered to effect a mission it will move to the target-province in a straight line and with full air movement. It can later be modified to carry a nuclear warhead. Historically this was the German Vergeltungswaffen 2/A4 (V2).;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_2_NAME;Reinforced Ribs;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_2_DESC;At this point some mid-air structural failures must be solved by adding reinforcing ribs, a so-called 'Corset' around the fuel tank area.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_1_NAME;Advanced Gyroscope Autopilot;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_1_DESC;The Advanced Gyroscope Autopilot is a very complex guidance control system used in the Flying Rocket. It forced the Flying Rocket to fly in a rather straight line to its target, while the autopilot corrected everything but natural effects. Only if it is updated by radio-signals will it hit its target without too much drift. It is fairly reliable if tested properly. However, due to its construction its accuracy will decrease proportionally to the range to the target.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_6_3_NAME;Flying Bomb;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_6_3_DESC;The Flying Bomb is a rather slow interceptable one-shot bomber unit with a low attack value of only 1 ton of TNT. Its poor accuracy will only allow it to conduct Terror Bombing missions. Its movement is a bit peculiar. In controlled territory it uses extremely slow land movement. When it is ordered to effect a mission it will move to the target-province in a straight line and with full air movement. If a certain bomber-class has been modified as a delivery vehicle, then it contains Flying Bombs when built. These may then only be launched from these aircraft in the air. It can later be modified to carry a nuclear warhead. Historically this was the German Vergeltungswaffen 1 (V1).;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_6_2_NAME;Modified Steering Fins;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_6_2_DESC;The steering fins are operated by the directional gyro of the guidance control system. Upon creation it was not thought possible that they could be disprupted by force, however, if the fins are moved too far in one or the other direction, the system stops working and the Flying Bomb crashes. By modifying the system it will be less vulnerable to external forces such as explosions or the wingtip of an aircraft for example.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_6_1_NAME;Launch Catapult;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_6_1_DESC;To be able to kick-start the ramjet engine of the Flying Bomb it must be launched from a specially-made catapult. To make one without decreasing the performance and accuracy of the Flying Bomb is the big problem.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_5_4_NAME;Sea-launch tests;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_5_4_DESC;These tests must be performed if you want to be able to launch Ballistic Missiles from a Submarine Container. The test is made with a number of different Submarines in different weather conditions to ensure optimal performance.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_5_3_NAME;Air-Launch tests;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_5_3_DESC;These tests must be performed if you want to be able to launch rockets from aircraft. The test is made with a number of different aircraft at different altitudes and speed to ensure optimal performance.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_5_2_NAME;Trajectory Test Flights;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_5_2_DESC;These tests must be performed to ensure that no structural damage destroys the rocket or that the external environment makes it deviate from its planned course.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_5_1_NAME;Ground Launch Tests;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_5_1_DESC;These tests must be performed to be able to launch the rocket without malfunction or the rocket deviating from its planned course.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_4_3_NAME;Ramjet Engine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_4_3_DESC;The Ramjet is simple in concept with the force of air ramming into the engine being sufficient for fuel to be introduced and ignited. The hot gases shooting through a tail pipe push the engine and the attached plane forward. Unfortunately, a ramjet does not begin to function unless its already travelling at a decent speed, requiring a second power plant, a launch catapult for example, to bring the rocket - or the aircraft - up to speed for the ramjet to take over.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_4_2_NAME;Liquid Fuel Rocket Engine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_4_2_DESC;A rocket motor works independently of the atmosphere carrying its own liquid fuel but also consuming it in a relatively short time.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_4_1_NAME;Solid Fuel Rocket Engine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_4_1_DESC;A rocket motor works independently of the atmosphere carrying its own solid fuel but also consuming it in a relatively short time.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_3_3_NAME;Gyroscope Autopilot;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_3_3_DESC;The Gyroscope Autopilot is a very simple guidance control system used in Flying Bombs. It forced the Flying Bomb to fly in a straight line to its target, while the autopilot merely corrected for side wind. A small timing device also provided a limited pre-set change of heading and means of arming it. It is not very reliable.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_3_2_NAME;Miniature Steam Engine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_3_2_DESC;The Miniature Steam Engine is used for driving LOX and alcohol fuel pumps.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_3_1_NAME;Liquid Rocket Fuel;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_3_1_DESC;Liquid Rocket Fuel is an important stepping-stone towards launching an advanced large rocket. It is rather reliable but sensitive to rough weather and environmental conditions. Vehicles propelled with it can attain the same high speed as those using the less advanced solid rocket fuel, but ranges are much greater due to the fuel's capacity of being portioned over time.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_2_3_NAME;Telemetrics Station;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_2_3_DESC;: The primary use for a Telemetric Station is to be able to correct structural deficiencies and test guidance control systems later on. It is a vital piece of equipment for further research.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_2_2_NAME;Test Range;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_2_2_DESC;The primary uses for Test Ranges are launch and trajectory tests later on. It is a vital piece of equipment for further research in the project.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_2_1_NAME;Wind Tunnels;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_2_1_DESC;The primary uses for Wind Tunnels are aerodynamic and jet engine testing later on. It is a vital piece of equipment for further research.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_12_3_NAME;Intercontinental Ballistic Missile;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_12_3_DESC;The ICBM is a fast non-interceptable one-shot bomber unit with a low attack value 1 ton of TNT. Its excellent hit accuracy will allow it to conduct Terror Bombing, Strategic Bombardment and Tactical Bombardment missions. When built in controlled territory it is silo-based and cannot move. When it is ordered to effect a mission it will move to the target-province in a straight line and with full air movement. Historically this model existed only as a drawing of the German Vergeltungswaffen 2/A10 (V2/A10).;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_12_2_NAME;ICBM Guidance System Computer;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_12_2_DESC;The ICBM Guidance System Computer is an even more complex guidance control system than the one used by the Ballistic Missile. It allows the ICBM to fly in a rather straight line to its target, while the autopilot corrects everything with very little deviation from the target. It can change heading a few degrees at several points, which are pre-set by time, during its flight. It is reliable if tested properly. However, due to its very complex construction, testing might take a long time. The main difference between the ICBM Guidance System Computer and the less complex version of its predecessor is that the longer distance travelled by the ICBM means that all figures must be updated minute by minute if the missile is required to hit its target.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_12_1_NAME;Multi-Stage Ballistic Missile Test Flights;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_12_1_DESC;Multi-Stage Ballistic Missile Test Flights have to be performed. These tests are completely different from previous tests. They must also be dimensioned for very large vehicles.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_11_2_NAME;Ballistic Missile ;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_11_2_DESC;The Ballistic Missile is a fast non-interceptable one-shot bomber unit with a low attack value of 1 ton of TNT. Its good accuracy will allow it to conduct Terror Bombing and Strategic Bombardment missions. Its movement is a bit peculiar. In controlled territory it uses extremely slow land movement. When it is ordered to effect a mission it will move to the target-province in a straight line and with full air movement. Historically this model existed only as a drawing of the German Vergeltungswaffen 2/A9 (V2/A9).;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_11_1_NAME;Gyrostabilized Launch Computer;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_11_1_DESC;The Gyrostabilized Launch Computer is a very complex guidance control system used in Ballistic Missiles and ICBMs. It allows the missile to fly in a rather straight line to its target, while the autopilot corrects everything with very little deviation from the target. It can change heading a few degrees at several points, which are pre-set by time, during its flight. It is rather reliable if tested properly. However, due to its very complex construction, testing might take a long time. It does not only work as a guidance control system, but also as a launching gyro-calculator correcting deviation from being launched at sea or from a moving object.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_10_1_NAME;Towed Submarine Container;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_10_1_DESC;The Towed Submarine Container is considered a Rocket Unit launching the Ballistic Missile. It consists of three containers towed by a Submarine Unit and contains the personnel, equipment and supplies to launch the rockets. In reality it can be doubted if a Flying Rocket could hit a designated target launching from a container in rough waters, but the Ballistic Missile is considered equipped with a gyro stabilizing computer and hydraulics.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_1_3_NAME;Joystick Wire Guidance;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_1_3_DESC;This semi-mechanical guidance control system works by sending electrical impulses from the control box to the weapon through a very thin cable. This enables the launch operator to guide the weapon with a joystick.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_1_2_NAME;Small Rocket Flight Tests;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_1_2_DESC;Small Rocket Flight Tests are necessary for further advancement into the research project. It means that extensive launch tests and trajectory tests of small rockets and prototypes for larger rockets are studied.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_1_1_NAME;Solid Rocket Fuel;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_1_1_DESC;Solid Rocket Fuel is the most basic fuel you need. It is very reliable and insensitive to rough weather and environment. Vehicles propelled with it can attain the same high speed as those using the more advanced liquid rocket fuel, but range is limited due to the propensity of solid fuels to have short burning times.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_9_3_NAME;Semi-Fission Bomb 235;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_9_3_DESC;This weak A-Bomb is a fast but inefficient use of bomb material. It is a fission bomb, but the fission is so inefficient because of the bad bomb material that less than 20% of it will actually fission. The production rate of this bomb is very low (0.5/Year). You now have an A-Bomb, but you still need a delivery vehicle such as a bomber aircraft or a ballistic missile to use it. Historically this was the Hiroshima-bomb.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_9_2_NAME;Nuclear Waste Bomb;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_9_2_DESC;This Poor Man's A-Bomb is not a fission bomb, but instead a conventional bomb that spreads radioactive waste over a large area. It is weak and you can only create a limited number of bombs from all the material you have produced. You now have an A-Bomb, but you still need a delivery vehicle such as a bomber aircraft or a ballistic missile to use it.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_9_1_NAME;Detonators;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_9_1_DESC;As with any fission it must be ignited by something, thus you must now research a functional and efficient detonator.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_8_4_NAME;Applied Rare Minerals;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_8_4_DESC;: In addition to the moderator and reflector materials there are a number of other rare minerals that must be obtained and used during the fission process. These minerals are Beryllium, Zirconium, Thallium, Lithium, Boron, Borax and Boric Acid.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_8_3_NAME;Core Structure;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_8_3_DESC;Nuclear fission is not only potentially very dangerous it is also used to produce electricity. The core structure is the large steel and concrete compartment the reactor core is placed in, and includes the coolant, all technical and electronic equipment and of course the turbine-generator that produces electricity. It also includes the containment of burned-out nuclear fuel. If this structure has deficiencies then fission is hazardous or cumbersome at least.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_8_2_NAME;Reflector;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_8_2_DESC;As electrons in fission are highly mobile, a reflector is needed to stop radioactive material from leaving the reactor core. The usable materials are Heavy Water, Beryllium and Graphite. The problem is to produce an acceptable reflector.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_8_1_NAME;Moderator;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_8_1_DESC;As the probability of fission is often much higher with slower electrons than with fast ones, a Nuclear Reactor needs a moderator to get the electrons up to optimal speed and thus ensure the most efficient fission. The usable materials are Heavy Water, Beryllium and Graphite. The problem is to produce an acceptable moderator.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_7_3_NAME;Heavy Water Plant;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_7_3_DESC;To be able to continue and perhaps expand your nuclear project you need a lot of Heavy Water for your reactor. By building a Heavy Water Plant you produce it, which will increase your chances of successfully producing bombs and energy later on. The Heavy Water Plant will increase the rate of nuclear bombs produced.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_7_2_NAME;Experimental Reactor;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_7_2_DESC;You need an Experimental reactor to test the design, make corrections and understand the problems with nuclear reactor handling.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_7_1_NAME;Thermal Diffusion Plant;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_7_1_DESC;This plant is essential for using uranium hexaflouride to separate the bomb material Uranium 235 from the fuel Uranium 238. With this plant you actually start producing bomb material for the Semi-fission bomb, which you can create as an application when you have researched Atomic Bomb Development. You do not need any other applications under Nuclear Reactor Design or Nuclear Reactor Operability.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_6_NAME;Catalyzer: Tritium;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_6_DESC;This Bomb Material is one of the four roads that lead to Atomic Bombs and Nuclear Power. When it has been analysed it can be tested much later together with the Fission Bomb 233, and applied in a Tritium Bomb. This is the most powerful A-Bomb in the game.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_5_NAME;Material: Uranium 235;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_5_DESC;This Bomb Material is one of the four roads that lead to Atomic Bombs and Nuclear Power. When it has been analysed it can be separated from the Nuclear Fuel Uranium 238 in a Thermal Diffusion Plant. It will eventually lead to the Semi-Fission Bomb 235, which is better than the Nuclear Material Bomb, but worse than Fission Bomb 233, Fission Bomb 239 and the Tritium Bomb.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_4_NAME;Material: Plutonium 239;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_4_DESC;This Bomb Material is one of the four roads that lead to Atomic Bombs and Nuclear Power. When it has been analysed it can be separated from the Nuclear Fuel Uranium 238 in an Experimental Reactor. It will eventually lead to the Fission Bomb 239, which is better than the Nuclear Material Bomb and the Semi-Fission Bomb 235, but worse than Fission Bomb 233 and the Tritium Bomb.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_3_NAME;Material: Uranium 233;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_3_DESC;This Bomb Material is one of the four roads that lead to Atomic Bombs and Nuclear Power. When it has been analysed it can be separated from the Nuclear Fuel Thorium 232 in an Experimental Reactor. It will eventually lead to the Fission Bomb 233, the second best A-Bomb in the game. Which is better than the Nuclear Material Bomb, the Semi-Fission Bomb 235, and the Fission Bomb 239, but worse than the Tritium Bomb.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_2_NAME;Fuel: Uranium 238;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_2_DESC;This Nuclear Fuel is one of the two roads that lead to Atomic Bombs and Nuclear Power. When it has been analysed it will open the road for research on the good Bomb Material Plutonium 239 and the average Uranium 235.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_1_NAME;Fuel: Thorium 232;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_1_DESC;This Nuclear Fuel is one of the two roads that lead to Atomic Bombs and Nuclear Power. When it has been analysed it will open the road for research on the excellent Bomb Material Uranium 233.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_5_2_NAME;Betatron Particle Accelerator;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_5_2_DESC;This object must be constructed and become operable to be able to accelerate particles so that they will not be repelled by other particles of the same charge. The main purpose is to learn more about moving particles on a sub-atomic level. However, the Betatron can also be used to bombard non-radioactive material such as steel with radioactive particles and thus create large chunks of radioactive waste. If you only want to produce a Nuclear Waste Bomb you do not need to research into any more applications until you have researched Atomic Bomb Development.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_5_1_NAME;Isotope Separation Facility;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_5_1_DESC;This facility 'cleans' natural uranium from the unwanted isotopes that may disrupt or stall fission with the fuel intended. The main purpose of the facility though, is to obtain an insight into how the radioactive atoms and their isotopes behave in a non-laboratory environment.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_12_2_NAME;Industrial Nuclear Power Plants;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_12_2_DESC;By modifying a nuclear reactor to maximize the output of electricity and adding to it sufficient equipment to store and transport electricity, vast amounts of Industrial Capacity can be supplied saving huge amounts of Coal and other resources.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_12_1_NAME;Nuclear Propulsion Engines;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_12_1_DESC;By designing a propulsion system based on a small nuclear reactor, an old dream of submariners will be fulfilled, unlimited range and high underwater speed. The problem is making the reactor small enough and to secure it safely so that the crew will not be affected by radiation.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_11_2_NAME;APDU Ammo;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_11_2_DESC;Armour Piercing Depleted Uranium Ammunition, or APDU for short, can at this point be researched for use with the heaviest artillery class. It will increase the Hard Attack value of your units considerably.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_11_1_NAME;Tritium Bomb;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_11_1_DESC;This A-Bomb is a very efficient use of bomb material. It is a true fission bomb boosted with tritium and ten times more powerful than both the 'normal' A-Bombs. The production rate of this bomb is good (2/Year). You now have an A-Bomb, but you still need a delivery vehicle such as a bomber aircraft or a ballistic missile to use it.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_10_3_NAME;Tritium Testing;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_10_3_DESC;Tritium can be used as a catalyst to boost the fission of Uranium 233, thus creating a Boosted A-Bomb. First the Lithium must be converted into Tritium in a Betatron Particle Accelerator, and then the scientists have to figure out how to control the catalyst phase of the fission. It will lead to the Tritium Bomb.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_10_2_NAME;Fission Bomb 239;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_10_2_DESC;This A-Bomb is a rather efficient use of bomb material. It is a true fission bomb, though Plutonium 239 limits its power somewhat. The production rate of this bomb is average (1.5/Year). You now have an A-Bomb, but you still need a delivery vehicle such as a bomber aircraft or a ballistic missile to use it. Historically this was the Nagasaki-bomb.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_10_1_NAME;Fission Bomb 233;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_10_1_DESC;This A-Bomb is a rather efficient use of bomb material. It is a true fission bomb, boosted with tritium it will become the Tritium Bomb. The production rate of this bomb is low (1/Year). You now have an A-Bomb, but you still need a delivery vehicle such as a bomber aircraft or a ballistic missile to use it.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_6_3_NAME;Nuclear Support Organization;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_6_3_DESC;In order for a navy to operate nuclear vessels an enormous support organization had to be developed. The navy organization would now have to operate nuclear material and nuclear waste material. It would have to construct maintenance facilities for the on-loading and off-loading of these materials. Furthermore it would have to train and equip an entire corps of nuclear operators and engineers to operate equipment and facilities. This Nuclear Support Organization was essential for a navy to operate nuclear vessels.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_6_2_NAME;Submarine Underway Replenishment;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_6_2_DESC;This doctrine was developed out of a necessity to supply a large submarine fleet while being denied access to the surface by the enemy. For a nation which does not have a large surface navy but a sizable submarine force it became very difficult to keep that submarine force supplied. Since the surface was controlled by the enemy the submarines would somwtimes have to use remote friendly ports where supplies would have to be routed overland. With the development of the Supply Submarine a new approach presented itself. An entire supply network could be established under the sea to keep the submarine force supplied. Historically this doctrine was implemented by the Germans who called their Supply Submarines 'Sea-Cows'.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_6_1_NAME;Maritime Power Projection Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_6_1_DESC;The Maritime Power Projection Doctrine was a refinement of the Maritime Air Superiority Doctrine and the Carrier Battle Group Doctrine. It stipulated that the concentration and coordination of naval aviation be used not only to assert air superiority, but to attain strategic national goals through the projection of maritime power. This allowed one or several task forces to approach a nation's waters and through force, or the threat of force, make that nation take a specific desired action. This doctrine was unique in that it allowed a naval force to have not only an impact on, but a total control of the actions on land. This doctrine lives on in a refined form today in modern times.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_7_NAME;SLOC Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_7_DESC;With the increased threat to merchant shipping convoys by the Sea-Lanes Denial Doctrine, it was critical to develop new operational guidelines. The Sea-Lanes Denial Doctrine stipulated that both Cruisers and Battleships should hunt and destroy convoys. However, it had been recognized that the heavy capital ships had become very vulnerable to naval aviation. The Carrier Battle Group Doctrine was proof of this. Therefore, to counter this new threat, a new doctrine which identified the importance of the sea-lanes as 'Sea-Lanes of Communication' - or SLOC - was developed. It was established that these SLOCs were instrumental to a powerful nation's survival, and that these should be protected as vigorously as the motherland's soil. The conclusion from this was that the new threat of Cruisers and Battleships directed against the convoys had to be countered by any means possible. Since these capital ships were highly vulnerable to naval aviation it was decided that Escort Air Carriers be developed to protect the convoys. These Escort Air Carriers where not equipped to be included in task forces as carrier groups, but were rather cheaply and rapidly produced.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_6_NAME;Operational Beachhead Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_6_DESC;The Operational Beachhead Doctrine was a further development of the Tactical Beachhead Doctrine but on a larger scale. The doctrine recognized the need for large formations to operate independently while conducting amphibious operations. This meant that the formations would have to carry with them onto the landing zone their own independent supply organization and command and control functions if they where to maintain the landing zone. The operational beachhead became instrumental in securing entry points for an invasion by ground units.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_5_NAME;Maritime Invasion Organization;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_5_DESC;: The Maritime Invasion Organization allowed the organization of troops and the development of technology for a large scale maritime invasion. This meant broadening the scope of the operation and giving it higher goals to attain. A large specialized supply organisation and special detachments must be formed in order to conduct a maritime invasion.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_4_NAME;Island-Jumping Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_4_DESC;Once the Base Control Doctrine had been established and implemented the need for a new advanced type of amphibious operations demanded a new doctrinal thinking. In some areas of the world, most notably the Pacific, the control of enemy naval bases meant that one had to control small islands in between the friendly bases and the enemy naval base in order to retain supply lines. These operations proved very difficult in terms of logistics. No unit was better fitted for the task than the Marine unit. Therefore, in order to control the enemy's naval bases, it became vital for an amphibious doctrine that could support these operations. This became the so called 'Island-Jumping' Doctrine.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_3_NAME;Submarine-Airforce Coordination;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_3_DESC;The different arms of the military had not been used to coordinating their operations in any real sense. During World War II however, it became critical for successful operations that the submarine force and the air force should cooperate and coordinate their operations. Obstacles had to be overcome at the command and control level to streamline logistics and signals systems. But it was also a matter of influencing the respective officer corps to realize the value of cooperation, and to force the implementation of the changes.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_2_NAME;Maritime Air Superiority Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_2_DESC;The Maritime Air Superiority Doctrine was a refinement of the Combat Air Patrol Doctrine and the Carrier Group Doctrine. It called for the carrier battle group to exert its airpower to not only cover the task force, but to create a state of friendly air superiority in the entire sea-zone. This doctrine meant that a task force with a carrier battle group could move into an area of operations creating air cover and air superiority within that sea zone thereby effectively minimizing the enemy air threat.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_1_NAME;Sea-Lanes Denial Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_1_DESC;The Sea-Lanes Denial Doctrine was a refinement of the Indirect Approach Doctrine. It stipulated that not only specific ships like cruisers, but all surface naval ships should be directed to the role of denying the enemy access to his sea-lanes. In essence this doctrine meant that naval warfare shifted focus. Air Carriers and naval aviation would destroy enemy naval ships while capital ships like Cruisers and Battleships should manouver into the enemy's sea-lanes and deny him the access to these sea-lanes, thereby disabling his ability to convoy.;;;;;;;;;;X

TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_4_2_NAME;Navy-Airforce Coordination;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_4_2_DESC;The different arms of the military had not been used to coordinating their operations in any real sense. During World War II however, it became critical for successful operations that the navy and the air force could cooperate and coordinate their operations. Obstacles had to be overcome on the command and control level to streamline logistics and signals systems. But it was also a matter of influencing the respective officer corps to realize the value of cooperation, and to force the implementation of the changes.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_4_1_NAME;Carrier Battlegroup Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_4_1_DESC;The Carrier Battle Group Doctrine was a refinement of the Carrier Group Doctrine and further recognized the need for naval air operations to counter the enemy's capital ships. The development of the Carrier Battle Group meant that the navy was prioritising the Air Carrier over the Battleship. No longer was the Battleship the grand centrepiece of the task force, but instead the group of air carriers carried the lion's share of the naval power at sea.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_7_NAME;Open Seas Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_7_DESC;The Open Seas Doctrine was a further refinement of the Sea-Lanes Doctrine. It further recognized the need for the large convoys to be protected from the increased threat of cruisers and submarine 'Wolfpacks'. In order to keep the sea-lanes open and protect the convoys special Escort Destroyers were developed. These Escort Destroyers where cheaper and built faster than the regular Destroyers, but they were not equipped to escort capital ships.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_6_NAME;Tactical Beachhead Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_6_DESC;The Tactical Beachhead Doctrine recognized the need for sub-units to operate independently while conducting amphibious operations. This meant that the sub-units would have to carry with them onto the landing zone their own independent supply organization and command and control functions if they were to maintain the landing zone. This became instrumental in amphibious operations, and such and independent self-sufficient landing-zones became known as a 'Beachhead'.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_5_NAME;Base Control Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_5_DESC;While the Base Defence Doctrine had recognized the need for protecting friendly naval bases, the development of the Marine unit now allowed the enemy's naval bases to be targeted and captured. It was recognized that it would become increasingly important to threaten, and if necessary capture, enemy naval bases in order to deny him their usage. If the enemy's use of friendly bases was crippled, it would decrease his operational range and his ability to threaten friendly territory.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_4_NAME;Wolfpack Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_4_DESC;This doctrine was developed from the need to coordinate submarines to hunt the large convoys of the sea-lanes. Previously submarines had operated independently with limited results. But the convoys of merchant shipping meant that once spotted and identified, a convoy was no longer safe if large groups of submarines would converge on it and attack it. This doctrine would prove highly effective.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_3_NAME;Combat Air Patrol Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_3_DESC;This doctrine recognized the need to protect the task force from enemy aircraft. This could be done by constantly maintaining friendly aircraft in the skies above the task force. These continuous operations put a high strain on personnel, materiel and supplies. When implemented the Combat Air Patrol Doctrine would place a protective shield over the task force defending it from enemy air threats.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_2_NAME;Indirect Approach Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_2_DESC;The Indirect Approach Doctrine was a refinement of the Merchant Raider Doctrine. It further recognized the success that could be gained by allowing cruisers to act as raiders, hunting down enemy merchant shipping. What set this doctrine apart from the Merchant Raider Doctrine was the recognition of the importance of hindering the enemy merchant shipping from reaching its destination. It was recognized that the battle of the seas had become less a battle between capital ships for the contest of the open seas, but rather a battle of keeping friendly sea-lanes open to shipping, while at the same time denying the enemy access to his sea-lanes. This doctrine stood in contrast to the Decisive Battle Doctrine stipulating the exact opposite thinking. However, these two doctrines were historically developed parallel to one another since they both derived from the same Blue Water Doctrine.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_1_NAME;Decisive Battle Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_1_DESC;The Decisive Battle Doctrine was a doctrine built on the Blue Water Doctrine. It called for a massive concentration of heavy capital ships to be formed into task forces that would theoretically overwhelm the enemy. It was a doctrinal approach of sheer force in numbers. Capital ships should be bigger and carry heavier firepower. These ships should then be massed into groups that would be undefeatable. This doctrine stood in contrast to the Indirect Approach Doctrine stipulating the exact opposite thinking. However, these two doctrines were historically developed parallel to one another since they both derived from the same Blue Water Doctrine.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_2_4_NAME;Naval Underway Replenishment;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_2_4_DESC;This doctrine allowed naval units to be supplied while at sea. This meant that they did not have to go into port as often as previously as most of their supplies could now be replenished while underway.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_2_3_NAME;Fleet Supply Convoy Organisation;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_2_3_DESC;The development of the Fleet Supply Convoy Organization allowed for naval units to be supplied more effectively than previously. The development of ships specifically tailored to carry fuel, ammunition and supplies allowed for a proper fleet supply organization. This should not be confused with the supply convoys of civilian merchant shipping.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_2_2_NAME;Unlimited Submarine Warfare Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_2_2_DESC;This doctrine allowed submarines to conduct all-out war on all enemy shipping, regardless of the shipping being civilian or military, and without the previous strict conditions of identification. This doctrine was not a development of military operational thinking, but rather a political decision that was not lightly taken. Submarines had had a limited use since it was difficult to identify ships positively, and since civilian shipping should not be targeted. But once the politicians had overcome their reluctance to use the submarine force indiscriminately, the submarines could be used effectively against all enemy shipping.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_2_1_NAME;Carrier Group Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_2_1_DESC;The Carrier Group Doctrine was a refinement of the Naval Aviation Doctrine and further recognized the need for naval air operations to counter the enemy's capital ships. This doctrine allowed air carriers to be coordinated into groups. The air carriers in these groups could coordinate their air operations in order to deliver more combat power to the enemy.   ;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_6_NAME;Base Defence Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_6_DESC;This doctrine was the second to recognize the need to protect the friendly naval bases. The old 19th century doctrine stated that it was crucial to not allow the enemy�s ships to strike at friendly naval bases while these where unprotected. In the Aftermath of the Great War the need for invasion defence against land units was highlighted. This led to the development of coastal fortifications and defences, and thus a more thorough doctrine. While this doctrine did not require the development of marine units, it would still define the doctrinal use and approach to amphibious operations late on in the war.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_5_NAME;Sea Lanes Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_5_DESC;This doctrine represented a new thinking in the shipping of supplies. In order to counter the doctrines and technologies that allowed the enemy to hunt and destroy a nation's merchant shipping, a new approach to shipping was needed. This became the Sea-Lanes Doctrine. It basically meant two things. Firstly, the shipping should be coordinated into massive convoys where the ships could be protected by the sheer size of the group, not unlike a shoal of fish. Secondly, these convoys could be moved across the oceans in predetermined sea-lanes which would be protected from the enemy.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_4_NAME;Combat Unit Transport Procedure;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_4_DESC;This was a procedure of operations rather than a doctrine. In order for ground units to be transported by ship to a friendly port it did not take much advanced technology. All industrialized nations had merchant ships that could be used as transports. But the task of organizing such transport was difficult and required experience. Thus in order for a nation to transport ground units by sea it must first acquire this knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_3_NAME;Naval Aviation Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_3_DESC;The Naval Aviation Doctrine led to the creation of the first air carriers. Previously capital ships had often carried a few aircraft onboard for use in the role of reconnaissance. But as the torpedo bomber was developed it was recognized that aircraft were very effective in countering the increasingly heavy capital ships. This led to the creation of ships dedicated to this task, the air carrier. The air carrier and its aircraft also needed specially-trained pilots which led to the creation of naval aviation. Ultimately this school of doctrine would lead to the death of the battleship and the refinement of the air carrier.;;;;;;;;;;x
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_2_NAME;Merchant Raider Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_2_DESC;This doctrine defined the role of the cruiser as a merchant raider. This school of thought proposed that the cruiser be taken away from the sea battle between capital ships and instead be used to hunt the open seas for enemy shipping. This was the first naval doctrine to target the enemy indirectly by going after his merchant shipping rather than destroying his ships.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_1_NAME;Blue Water Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_1_DESC;This doctrine stipulated that the capital ships of the navy, the battleships and the cruisers, should conduct combat away from the coastal waters in the deep open waters on the ocean. This was called the Blue Water Doctrine as opposed to the Brown Water Doctrine used earlier by some nations. This doctrine did not emphasise a specific objective for keeping the capital ships on the deep open seas, rather it concluded that combat between capital ships should be conducted there. It was a theory of combat philosophy rather than a strict operational conduct.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_9_9_NAME;Advanced Destroyer Anti-Air Armament;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_9_9_DESC;This was a new anti-air system integrating the anti-air guns with new radars and targeting systems. It raised the air defence capability of the Destroyer significantly. It was however, not implemented on the capital ships as air defences were viewed as a 'minor duty' by the naval officer corps.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_9_8_NAME;Improved Centimetric Naval Radar Navigation;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_9_8_DESC;Improved Centimetric Naval Radar Navigation allowed a surface vessel to navigate with radar. It gave it an increased operational capability in poor weather conditions and at night.;;;;;;;;;;X

TECH_APP_NAVAL_9_5_DESC;The Destroyer was a vessel designed to protect the capital ships of a task force. The Destroyer would protect ships such as Battleships, Cruisers and Air Carriers from attacks by aircraft and submarines. The Destroyer was also used to escort convoys. This 'Advanced'-class Destroyer had a weight of over 2,000 tonnes, could reach speeds of up to 40 knots and had a 120+mm Naval Gun as its main armament.;;;;;;;;;;X

TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_6_3_DESC;The introduction of the Operational Manoeuvre Warfare Doctrine demanded that formation command units could Manoeuvre in conjunction with the units under its command. This required a re-organization of the headquarters from a static command post to an airborne command post. This led to a reform in command operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_6_2_NAME;Division Long-Range Reconnaissance Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_6_2_DESC;This doctrine was implemented from the need to identify and pinpoint the enemy main force and its positions for its encirclement and destruction. It was acknowledged that this had to be conducted by a special force specifically equipped and organized for the task. This became the first long-range reconnaissance formation. This was a doctrine of the School of Offensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_6_1_NAME;Task Force Offensive Organization;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_6_1_DESC;This organization was developed through extensive field tests based on the experience drawn from fighting late in the war. The implementation of these task forces, which the Germans called 'Kampfgruppe' and the Americans dubbed 'Team' was made through the Operational Manoeuvre Warfare Doctrine. This was an organization based on the School of Offensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_8_NAME;Operational Manoeuvre Warfare Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_8_DESC;Perhaps the most famous doctrine of the war, the Operational Maneuvre Warfare Doctrine, or 'Blitzkrieg'-doctrine, was the fundamental doctrine that would dominate land warfare for almost 50 years. The doctrine called for armoured formations to attack the enemy defensive positions to achieve a break-through. This break-through would then be optimally utilized to press further armoured formations through it, which would break out behind enemy lines and conduct exploitation operations. The goal of this doctrine was not necessarily the destruction of enemy forces, but rather the destruction of the enemy's will to fight. The exploiting units should quickly manoeuvre to seize key points and objectives of strategic importance to the enemy, persuading him that he was defeated before the military issue was settled. In essence, operational manoeuvre warfare aims to force pursuit, which results in highly lopsided fighting situations and easy victories, as opposed to attrition oriented or set piece battles, which generally yield heavy losses for both sides.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_7_NAME;Armoured Spearhead Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_7_DESC;The organizational questions raised by the Force Concentration Doctrine led to the development of the Armoured Spearhead Doctrine. This doctrine implemented a new flexible task-oriented organization on the sub-unit level that allowed a unit to concentrate its force effectively. This organization called for standard sub-units in a flexible command structure, allowing for sub-units to be combined and re-combined in a free fashion to form small task forces with a specific mission. It was perhaps not so much the organization of the sub-unit that proved pivotal, but rather the organization and training of the command structure and officer corps. This was a doctrine of the School of Offensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_6_NAME;Force Concentration Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_6_DESC;The Force Concentration Doctrine was an integral part of the Operational Manoeuvre Warfare Doctrine. It called for the necessity of the rapid concentration of force at the decisive point - what the Germans called the 'Schwerpunkt'. This concentration had to happen very quickly in a coordinated fashion at the time of the break-through, while still maintaining unit cohesion. It was fundamentally important to be able to shift the axis of manoeuvre in order for the combat power to convene. The restriction of the doctrine was how to organize units and sub-units in a fashion that allowed them to implement this doctrine. This was a doctrine of the School of Offensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_5_NAME;Opposed Obstacle Crossing Operations;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_5_DESC;The increase in mechanization had allowed for the development of new equipment that could be utilized to cross water obstacles under enemy fire. These operations were technically very difficult and required perfection in training in order to ensure success on the battlefield. Once effectively mastered the Opposed Obstacle Crossing Operation proved an invaluable tool in operational warfare. This was a doctrine of the School of Offensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_4_NAME;Synchronized Artillery Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_4_DESC;The improvements in combined arms warfare and manoeuvre artillery enabled the delivery of massive artillery fire in exact co-ordination with units in the forward area. This doctrine called for a synchronization of different artillery units in real-time to allow for a previously unseen concentration of fire. This was an extremely effective way of halting and channelling enemy spearheads that had broken through the defensive lines. The only restriction of the doctrine was the speed by which reconnaissance intelligence could be relayed to the firing units. This was a problem that the Soviet Union developed further into the Reconnaissance Strike Complex Doctrine, and which it would continue to develop over the next 50 years.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_3_NAME;Special Operations Warfare Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_3_DESC;This doctrine was brought about by the thinking that small specially trained and equipped teams could be used as advanced long-range reconnaissance and saboteur units. These units were expensive to train, but once employed they proved very valuable.;;;;;;;;;;X

TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_2_DESC;;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_1_NAME;Elastic Defence Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_1_DESC;The introduction of the Operational Manoeuvre Warfare Doctrine had proved that the Deep Area Defence Doctrine could not hold back the spearheads of the 'Blitzkrieg'-operations. In response the Elastic Defence Doctrine was developed. It still called for a multi-layered defence in fortified positions. But it complemented those defences with a small but highly lethal armoured force close behind the layers in depth. When the enemy attacked and broke through the first layer the defender could identify the axis of the main attack. When that attack was entangled in the second layer the armoured reserve struck. Once the enemy had been repelled or destroyed, the first layer moved to a new defensive position behind the second layer. In this leapfrog fashion with armoured reserves the enemy could be defeated. This was a doctrine of the School of Defensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_7_NAME;Mechanized HQs;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_7_DESC;The introduction of the combined arms warfare doctrine demanded that formation command units could manoeuvre in conjunction the units under its command. This required a re-organization of the headquarters from a static command post to a mobile command post. This led to a reform in command operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_6_NAME;Forward Area Logistics Organization;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_6_DESC;The Forward Area Logistics Organization allowed a ground combat unit to be re-supplied while manuevring at the forward area rather then having to pull back to a rear-area supply point.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_5_NAME;Motorized Logistics Organization;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_5_DESC;As the military of the war became more technology-intensive and vehicles and calibres became heavier, the logistics became ever more important. The increased motorization and mechanization of the ground combat units also required much more fuel than previously, and so the logistical system had to manage many hundreds of tons where previously it had handled a few dozen tons. An organization that could deal with these volumes at the correct speed had to be developed.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_4_NAME;Signal Intelligence Operations;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_4_DESC;The technological development of signal interception and jamming units led to the development of operations aimed at attrition and disrupting the enemy command structure. These operations internalised the use of this equipment and the units tasked with this became a new troop of arms.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_3_NAME;Corps Long-Range Reconnaissance Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_3_DESC;This doctrine was implemented from the need to identify and pinpoint the enemy main force and its positions for its encirclement and destruction. It was acknowledged that this had to be conducted by a special force specifically equipped and organized for the task. These became the first long-range reconnaissance formations. This was a doctrine of the School of Offensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_2_NAME;Divisional Offensive Organization;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_2_DESC;This organization was developed through extensive field tests based on the experience drawn from World War I. The regimen defined combat operation procedures for units. This was an organization based on the School of Offensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_1_NAME;Divisional Defensive Organization;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_1_DESC;This organization was developed through extensive field tests based on the experience drawn from World War I. The regimen defined combat operation procedures for units. This was an organization based on the School of Defensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_3_5_NAME;Triphibious Operations Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_3_5_DESC;The development of several doctrinal schools for specialised troops like Marines and Paratroops and improved combined arms warfare had led to the possibility of synchronizing all these elements in combat operations on the operational level. This allowed for Marines and Paratroops and Tactical Bombers to function in a synchronized manner for combat operations. This in its turn opened the door for a multitude of operational benefits. This was a doctrine of the School of Offensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_3_4_NAME;Deep Area Defence Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_3_4_DESC;The School of Defensive doctrine needed a new operational thinking to counter the increased mobility of the enemy. The Static Defence Doctrine had to be complemented to counter this threat. The answer lay in denying the enemy any manoeuvrability. This, it was thought, could be achieved by employing several layers of static fortified defences. This would enable a defence in depth. Should the enemy break through the first defence, he would find himself pinned against the next one, unable to manoeuvre. This was a doctrine of the School of Defensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_3_3_NAME;Combined Arms Warfare Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_3_3_DESC;The Combined Arms Warfare Doctrine was one of the most important doctrinal developments of the war. During the inter-war years the army had been given a new tool: the tank. This tool, it was felt, could - and should - be a pivotal inventory on the battlefield. However, the views of how the tank was to be applied were many. Some doctrinal scholars and officers believed it should replace the cavalry, the tank should be employed on a platoon-basis and act as a reconnaissance force. Others believed the tank should be employed along with the infantry as a direct support tool. But still others believed the tank should be employed on a battalion and regimental level, and that specific tank formations should be developed. These formations would have an impact on the operational level rather than on the tactical level proposed by the supporters of the cavalry and infantry-support schools. These formations should then be the pivotal tool on the battlefield, not the tank in itself. This doctrine also proposed an increased mechanization of all other units and that different troops like infantry, artillery and air-support should be synchronized to function as a force of combined arms, the Combined Arms Warfare Doctrine. This was a doctrine of the School of Offensive Operations. The doctrine would be a cornerstone in the development of the Operational Manoeuvre Warfare Doctrine.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_3_2_NAME;Counter Artillery Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_3_2_DESC;With the development of the Counter-Battery Radar it was possible to track the shells of enemy artillery and calculate its position. This led to a series of actions and reactions, deployments and regrouping by the artillery as it struggled to maintain or obtain fire superiority. An increased number of fire missions were used for counter artillery missions, but the overall effectiveness of the fire support increased as it was possible to suppress and/or destroy the enemy artillery, thereby creating a favourable correlation of forces and means.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_3_1_NAME;Manoeuvre Artillery Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_3_1_DESC;The Manoeuvre Artillery Doctrine was developed as a result of the increased mobility of units and the increased tempo of operations. The deployed static artillery unit could not effectively support the forward battle area as it moved too rapidly for the artillery to keep up with it. The artillery was forced to create new equipment, new fire procedures, new organization and new training to allow the artillery to be effectively employed. This led to the creation of new mobile artillery units that could deploy faster. This was a doctrine of the school of offensive operations. The Manoeuvre Artillery Doctrine would be a cornerstone in the development of the Combined Arms Warfare Doctrine and the Self Propelled Artillery.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_2_4_NAME;Tactical Defensive Regimen;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_2_4_DESC;This reglement was developed through extensive field tests based on the experience drawn from World War I. The reglement defined combat operations procedures for sub-units. This was a reglement based on the school of defensive operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_2_3_NAME;Motorized HQs;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_2_3_DESC;The introduction of the motorized warfare doctrine demanded that formation command units could manoeuvre in conjunction the units under its command. This required a re-organization of the headquarters from a static command post to a semi-mobile command post. This led to a reform in command operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_2_2_NAME;Army Long-Range Reconnaissance Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_2_2_DESC;This doctrine was implemented from the need to identify and pinpoint the enemy main force and its positions for its encirclement and destruction.

TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_1_4_NAME;Specialist Warfare Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_1_4_DESC;The Specialist Warfare Doctrine recognized the need for an optimisation of formations earmarked for specific terrain and environmental conditions. The colonial possessions of many European nations meant that formations and personnel used to the temperate conditions would now have to operate in tropical, sub-tropical and arctic conditions. This doctrine internalised these needs into an organizational thinking that allowed for optimised equipment and training.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_1_3_NAME;Encirclement-Destruction Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_1_3_DESC;The Encirclement-Destruction Doctrine proposed that the enemy's main force be identified by probing and once identified it should be fixed while the unit main force encircled the enemy with the goal of destroying him. This doctrine changed previous thinking that the enemy main force be attacked by the entire unit force with the goal of repelling him from his defensive position rather than destroying him in it. This was a doctrine of the School of Offensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_1_2_NAME;Motorized Warfare Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_1_2_DESC;The Motorized Warfare Doctrine effectively introduced a unit and sub-unit organization that could transport men and materials with motorized equipment like trucks and other haulers. This allowed a unit to move more rapidly than it had been able to previously. It also allowed it to carry far more equipment and supplies. The implementation of this doctrinal change of organization and equipment further allowed a unit to respond more quickly to enemy action. This was the first step towards the manoeuvre warfare and mechanization of the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_1_1_NAME;Static Defence Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_1_1_DESC;The Static Defence Doctrine proposed that the best manner to defend territory against the enemy was to prepare strong defensive fortifications and perimeters in which infantry would defend supported by artillery. This doctrine did not emphasise the need for mobility, motorization or manoeuvre. Instead the shared weight of fortifications and obstacle preparations should slow, channel and finally halt the enemy advance. This was a doctrine of the School of Defensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X

TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_6_2_DESC;The Air Superiority Doctrine stipulated that an airforce should exert its airpower to not only cover and defend specific targets, but to create a state of friendly air superiority in the entire theatre of operations. The air superiority would thereby effectively minimize the enemy air threat. The doctrine futher stipulated that the air superiority should be achieved initally in advance of ground operations. Once superiority was achieved, objectives on the ground could be achieved decisively with minimal losses.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_6_1_NAME;Nuclear First Strike Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_6_1_DESC;The Nuclear First Strike Doctrine allowed a nation to use nuclear weapons pre-emptively.

TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_5_3_NAME;Terror Bombing Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_5_3_DESC;The Terror Bombing Doctrine was built on the technique of the Carpet Bombing Doctrine. However, it did not target the enemy's industrial complex but rather the civilian population and the nation's will to fight. It was employed with great success against civilian population centers utilizing fuel explosives to create firestorms in the target. This doctrine yielded very high civilian casualties for the enemy and was effective in eliminating the enemy's resolve to fight.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_5_2_NAME;Close Air Support Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_5_2_DESC;The Close Air Support Doctrine was a further development of the Air-Land Battle Doctrine. Previously the unit commander had directed the the air support from the command post, now the ground commander on the forward edge of the battle area could direct the airsupport directly. It gave air power a role as a highly mobile reserve for the ground units.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_5_1_NAME;Wingman Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_5_1_DESC;The Wingman Doctrine replaced the Combat Training Team Doctrine. The Wingman Doctrine further minimized the number of aircraft to be closely coordinated in air combat. This doctrine stipulated that aircraft be coordinated in groups of two aircraft with one of them the senior leader. The other aircraft would support the first and act as a guard. This doctrine required a high level of training of pilots, but proved very effective in air combat. It was the forerunner of doctrines for air combat today in modern times.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_4_3_NAME;Bomb-Runner Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_4_3_DESC;The Bomb-Runner Doctrine allowed a strategic bomber equipped with a radar navaigation device to lead an entire airunit onto the target area. The aircraft equipped with the radar navigation device, by the British called 'Bomb-Runner', would lead the air unit in formation to the taret and release the bombload. This would signal the rest of the air unit and the bombing of the taret would be synchronized. This doctrine was related to the Radar Scout Doctrine in that it was developed from a need to utilize the radar equipment optimally.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_4_2_NAME;Radar Scout Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_4_2_DESC;With the development of effective airborne radars it was possible for the air unit to attain information about the enemy without the assistance of the ground. Not only was the airborne radar techically superior to the radar warning sites, but it also cut the time it took to relay the information. Airborne radar however were very expensive and difficult to operate. It was recognized that they could not be installed in all aircraft. The Radar Scout Doctrine allowed for one aircraft in the air unit, or the combat training team, to be equipped with an airborne radar, allowing that aircraft to relay information about the enemy to other aircraft via radio.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_4_1_NAME;Air-Land Battle Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_4_1_DESC;The Air-Land Battle Doctrine stipulated that the airforce be optimally suited to function in conjunction with ground forces. This meant a coordination of command and communications had to take place. This doctrine viewed the airpower as an indriect fire tool to be used as a complement to artillery for ground commanders. These components should be brought to bear on the enemy with a synergetic effect. This doctrine was a result of the Combined Arms Warfare Doctrine and the theories of force concentration.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_3_5_NAME;Area Anti-Air Defence Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_3_5_DESC;The Area Anti-Air Defence Doctrine did not replace the Point Anti-Air Defence Doctrine, rather it complemented it. Air defences were still concentrated at key points per the Point Anti-Air Defence Doctrine, but they where complemented by a new form of area defences. These area defences were made up of several battalion-sized squares that were coordinated centrally. These squares, called 'Grossbatterien' by the Germans, where positioned to form a network or maze into which the enemy bombers had to fly. The network was changed regularly so that the enemy could not manouver around them.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_3_4_NAME;Vertical Envelopment Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_3_4_DESC;The Airborne Assault Doctrine allowed for entire units to be para-dropped. The Vertical Envelopment Doctrine allowed for units to be para-dropped over an enemy controlled area of operations, a so-called opposed para-drop. While previous air and land doctrines had recognized the need to envelop the enemy on a two-dimensional level, the Vertical Envelopment Doctrine allowed for a three-dimensional envelopment of the enemy. While land units could encircle and envelop the enemy on the ground, paraunits could be launched against the enemy to create a flank from above to create further pressure on the enemy. It was a risky doctrine and the operations often yielded high levels of casualties, but used properly it was a tremendous tool.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_3_3_NAME;Mechanized Airborne Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_3_3_DESC;The Mechanized Airborne Doctrine recognized the potential of the Airborne Tank and implemented its use in airborne operations. The Airborne Tank was transported by glider and could begin operating immediately after landing. The Mechanized Airborne Doctrine stipulated that the Airborne Tank be used primarily as a reconnaisance vehicle to allow for the expansion of the paratroop division's area of operations. But it could also operate as tactical reserve for the division commander.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_3_2_NAME;Carpet Bombing Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_3_2_DESC;The Carpet Bombing Doctrine stipulated that large formations of strategic bomber units be coordinated to deliver their bombloads over large areas. This doctrine allowed for the destruction of a large designated area. The carpet bombing would target the enemy's industrial complexes from a high altitude.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_3_1_NAME;Combat Training Team Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_3_1_DESC;The Combat Training Team Doctrine replaced the 'Flying Circus' Doctrine. With the introduction of radio communications between individual aircraft it was possible to retain a higher level of coordination. It proved inefficient to coordinate entire fighter wings or squadrons in air combat, and it also proved to be an ineffective way of developing experienced fighter pilots. This new doctrine instead stipulated that aircraft be coordinated in groups of up to five aircraft including a senior experienced pilot, two experienced pilots and two junior pilots. The senior experienced pilot would train the other group members and lead them in air operations. When the pilots became more experienced and gained in seniority they would leave the team and create a new team under their command. A squadron or wing was made up of several such teams.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_2_2_NAME;Sheltered Airfields Organization;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_2_2_DESC;As more focus was shifted towards destroying the enemy's air power by attacking his airbases it became increasingly important to protect those facilities, and most importantly the aircraft on the ground. With the introduction and implementation of hardened aircraft shelters the aircraft retained a high degree of protection against enemy airfield attacks.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_2_1_NAME;Home Chain Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_2_1_DESC;With the development of effective radar warning sites it became possible for a ground command station to direct the airborne aircraft to their targets. Previously airborne aircraft had to patrol and detect the enmy visually. Now they could be directed and coordinated with a vastly improved precision and speed. The airborne warning sites, called 'Home Chain' by the British, relayed information to the air unit command and control facility which relayed the information to the airborne air unit.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_1_4_NAME;Point Anti-Air Defence Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_1_4_DESC;The Point Anti-Air Defence Doctrine recognized the need to protect certain key industries and facilities against air attack. This doctrine stipulated that air defences should be concentrated at these key points and coordinated centrally for increased effectivness.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_1_3_NAME;Airborne Assault Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_1_3_DESC;The Airborne Assault Training had allowed for sub-units to be para-dropped into an area of operations. The Airborne Assault Doctrine allowed for entire units to be para-dropped. This allowed for the paratroop division to function as a highly manouverable and transportable strategic reserve. The unit would be para-dropped over the area of operations and proceed overland to conduct combat operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_1_2_NAME;Blitz Bombing Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_1_2_DESC;As airframe design improved it was possible to construct aircraft that could endure steep dives at high speeds. This new technology allowed an aircraft to deliver a bomb from a vertical rather than a horizontal attack angle. This increased the bombing precision many fold, and it also made for a minimal exposure to ground fire. The implementation of this new technology into the Dive-Bomber and its use was the cornerstone of the 'Blitz' Bombing Doctrine. The doctrine called for the Dive-Bomber to be used as direct-support for ground units. The dive-bomber became a complement to the artillery for ground commanders.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_1_1_NAME;Flying Circus Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_1_1_DESC;The 'Flying Circus' Doctrine was the first doctrine for fighter unit combat. The doctrine centered around the air unit, either a squadron or a wing. The essence of the doctrine was that the air unit should function as a combat unit in air operations. While radio communications between individual aircraft was still rare, the coordination of operations had to take place through hand signals and other visual means. The air unit was lead by the squadron or wing commander, often a so called 'Ace' with extensive combat experience. The junior members of the unit had to learn the ropes by watching the actions of senior members of the unit. Air combat should be concluded decisively by the air unit, often known as a 'Flying Circus', through the initiative of the unit leader, and the remaining number of aircraft in the unit should be used to overwhelm the enemy and force pursuit.;;;;;;;;;;x

TECH_AIR_DOC_NAME;Air Warfare Doctrines;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_AIR_DOC_DESC;A military doctrine can be described as a paradigmatic solution to certain formulated problems of war. It defines the goal, the means and the operational procedures of the combat, the doctrine may define these issues in the scope of strategic, operational and tactical operations. The field of doctrines is at least as important as a nation's gains in technological research. An airforce equipped with the latest equipment will be defeated by an enemy with a more advanced doctrinal approach to combat. It is also very important for a nation to make decisions on whether to develop a defensive or offensive doctrine since it will be costly to maintain two doctrines.;;;;;;;;;;x

TAN_DESC;Tannu Tuva has long been involved in a complicated relationship between Russia and China.  First occupied by by Dzhungar Khan Galdan in 1688, the land came under Mongol rule.  In 1758 when Dzhungaria was defeated by the Chinese the territory was under the dominion of Manchuria. During the middle 19th century, because of mutual interest of Tannu Tuva and Russia, the Tuvans began to allow Russian merchants to trade duty free.  In the late 1800s tensions rose as the Tuvans began a series of rebellions against their rulers. Ofter the fall of the Tsin Empire in China Tannu Tuva moved to liberate itself from Chinese rule.  Knowing that as a small and weak nation they could not expect to remain independence they sought the protection of Russia, becoming a Russian protectorate in 1914.  After the Russian Revolution the Attorney of the Siberian revolutionary committee of RSFSR I.G. Safianov declared that 'Now the Soviet government considers Uryankhai (Tuva) independent as before' and in August 1921 the Peoples Republic of Tannu Tuva was formed.  The small nation in the center of Asia was primarily an agrarian society with little industry (mostly coal and gold mining).  The nation also maintained close ties with the Soviet government.;;;;;;;;;;x

SWE_DESC;In 1818 Karl XIV Johann was crowned the first king of the still ruling house of Bernadotte. Neutrality became the guideline of Swedish freign policy from then on. Even though Oskar I (1844 - 1859) supported Denmark in her first war against the German Leage (1848 - 1850) Sweden insisted on its neutrality during the Crimean War (1853 - 1856) and the 2nd German-Danish War of 1864 which allowed for the country's unhindered developmen into a parliamentary democracy. In 1865/66 a bicameral system was introduced and a Liberal cabinet was established in 1905. In 1909 Gustav V (1907 - 1950) acknowledged universal suffrage for the Second Chamber of parliament, eventually making Sweden a constitutional monarchy. The union with Norway broke in 1905, defeating the idea of a panscandinavian stae which had especially been envisioned by Karl XV (1859 - 1872). During World War I (1914 - 1918) Sweden remained neutral and became the starting point of many peace efforts, particularly from the socialist side. The Social Democrats became the strongest party in 1920 and foraged the government numerous times till 1936. Under the impact of the Great Depression which reached in 1931/32 even the highly advanced Swedish agriculture and industry a welfare state was created which became a rolemodel for most of Western Europe.;;;;;;;;;;x

Seperatist movements like those of the Basques or the Catalans gained support, the church interfered in politics, and a radical workers movement destabalized the balance between conservatives and liberals. After taking the governmentin 1902 Alfons XIII showed expansionist tendencies as demonstrated by the intervention in Morocco.. The Algeciras Act of 1906 did acknowledge Spanish interests in Morocco, institutionalized by a protectorate over the north and south of the African country in 1912, but it became a source of permanent unrest. During World War 1 Spain remained neutral. After 1918 the social tensions erupted in a number of revolts by the rural populace and right wing as well as anarchistic factions. Alfons XIII supported the military coup against the government by General Miguel Primo de Rivera who abolished the constitution of 1876 and installed a dictatorial rule between 1923 and 1930. He ended the uprising in Morocco with a victory over Abd el-Krim in 1926, but could not master the economic crisis and had to resign after repeated revolts by the military and students. In 1931 Alfons XIII also abdicated and allowed the Liberal Conservative Niceto Alcal� Zamora y Torres the proclamation of the Second Republic.The republic, however, could not overcome the deep rift between the factions of the Spanish society, reaching from fascist Falangists to monarchists, conservative liberals, left liberals, socialists, communists and Anarcho-Syndicalists.

In 1939 Franco achieved - supported militarily by both Germany and Italy - victory over the People's Front who had been favored by the USSR and Mexico and who had signed up the aid of the International Brigades of Republicans, Socialists, and Communists from all over the world. After the victory Franco established an authoritarian regime with a constitution patterned for him as 'Caudillo' (leader). The Falange movement became the party to secure his domestic power. Despite advances from Hitler, Franco declined all offers for an alliance with the Axis during the war and only detached the Blue Division of volunteers to the campaign in Russia.;;;;;;;;;;x

SOV_DESC;No other nation suffered such domestic political turmoil as Russia during the Great War, which saw the ancient throne of the Romanov Tsars toppled and the vast empire of Peter the Great and Alexander II fall into the hands of a mass revolutionary movement , the Bolshevik Marxists of Vladimir Illych Lenin. Renamed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the country was rededicated to the spread of revolutionary communist ideology across the world, making it a pariah amongst the decadent capitalist economies of Europe. After Lenin�s death and a series of behind-the-scenes intrigues, his lieutenant Josef Stalin emerged as the heir to the Bolshevik legacy. By a ferocious policy of industrialization and an equally uncompromising attitude towards political foes, Stalin has by 1936 consolidated his position as supreme ruler of the USSR and returned the once-battered and ignored Russian state to the diplomatic table as a major power. But many strategic dilemmas haunt him. Should Russia seek to expand into the lost territories of Eastern Europe, or strike southwards to the blue waters of the Indian Ocean? Can a deal be brokered with the British and French - or even Hitler and Mussolini? What of the Japanese and their designs? ;;;;;;;;;;X
SOV_41_DESC;When Molotov brokered his surprise deal with his German counterpart von Ribbentropp in the summer of 1939, few observers expected the unnatural partnership between the Nazis and the Soviets to last for long. Indeed, Stalin saw the non-aggression treaty as a breathing space which he could use to build up his military forces and expand his territorial buffer zone in Eastern Europe. But while the USSR took over the Baltic States and large parts of Romania without difficulty, Finland's stubborn resistance against overwhelming Russian opposition in the 'Winter War' of 1939-1940 humiliated the Red Army: and Germany's faster-than-expected triumph in France left Stalin's timetable of rearmament lagging dangerously behind. In June 1941 Hitler finally abandoned his distasteful d�tente with the 'Bolshevik' enemy and attacked the USSR in a massive continent-wide onslaught that left hundreds of thousands of Russian troops surrounded and broken. The Soviets retreated as best they could, doggedly resisting everywhere, but their army was clearly incapable of holding back the initial German torrent. Only the arrival of the September rains and winter snow finally stalled the Wehrmacht. As December arrives, welcome new has come from the Far East: with Japan now engaged against the British and Americans, the Russians can safely transfer their Siberian forces to defend Moscow and spearhead a long-awaited counter-attack. But Russia's position remains critical, and Stalin will need all his reserves of peasant cunning to overcome the crisis.;;;;;;;;;;x
SOV_39_DESC;No other nation suffered such domestic political turmoil as Russia during the Great War, which saw the ancient throne of the Romanov Tsars toppled and the vast empire of Peter the Great and Alexander II fall into the hands of a mass revolutionary movement  the Bolshevik Marxists of Vladimir Illych Lenin. Renamed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the country was rededicated to the spread of revolutionary communist ideology across the world, making it a pariah amongst the decadent capitalist economies of Europe. After Lenin's death and a series of behind-the-scenes intrigues, his lieutenant Josef Stalin emerged as the heir to the Bolshevik legacy. By a ferocious policy of industrialization and an equally uncompromising attitude towards political foes, Stalin consolidated his position as supreme ruler of the USSR and returned the once-battered and ignored Russian state to the diplomatic table as a major power. But many strategic dilemmas continue to haunt him. The surprise rapprochement with Communism's bitterest ideological foe, Nazi Germany, gives the USSR a chance to expand in Eastern Europe while Hitler is busy fighting the British and French. But whether this artificial peace can be sustained for long is questionable. And never forget Japan, far to the East.;;;;;;;;;;x

SLO_DESC;Seeing the continuing discrimination of their people under the double monarchy of Austria-Hungary Slovakian politicians and intellectuals were convinced that only joining with the Czechs would lead the way out of their national misery. Representatives of immigrated Slovaks in the U.S.A. agreed with the Czech nationalists Thom�s Garrigue Masaryk and Eduard Benes on a united state of the Czechs and the Slovaks. This new country was proclaimed as independent republic by the name of Czechoslovakia in Prague 1918. After over 1000 years of foreign rule the Slovaks, making up around 30 percent of the total Czechoslovakian population together with the Czechs as equals in an autonomous state. But soon unrest stirred about the predominance of the Czechs which found, among others, its expression in the establishing of centralized strcutures. Main power of the anti-Czech resistance was the catholic conservative Slovakian People's Party (SPP), calling for extensive autonomy. When after trhe Munich Treaty of 1938 Czechoslovakia the Sudeten regions were ceded to Germany the SPP seized the opportunity and exploited the acute weakness of the government in Prague and achieved a federalization of Czechoslovakia. In March 1939 Germany broke the Munich Treaty and occupied the Czeck part of the country, turning it into the 'Reichsprotektorat B�hmen und M�hren' (Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia). A day earlier, by call of Adolf Hitler, Slovakia had declared her independence. Formally independent, Slovakia was de facto a vassall of Germany, although the new country was recognized by 25 statesm among the Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The government of Prime Minister Jozef Tisos, a catholic priest, followed, under close watch from Berlin, a conservative authoritarian policy.;;;;;;;;;;x

SIK_DESC;Sinkiang played a crucial role in the The Great Game between the region's major powers, located as it was between Russia and British India. Both powers soon became active in trading in the province, although the Manchus had imposed a ban on European trade in the area. According to a Soviet source, 'the British, with their record in India, were the more dreaded of the two, and Peking lived in constant fear of intrigue in East Turkestan by these inveterate colonizers.' However, despite British efforts, Russia eventually gained the upper hand in the area. As a result of a number of the 'unequal treaties' which China was forced to sign with the Western powers after the Opium Wars, specifically the Ili Treaty (1851), the Tacheng Protocol of the Treaty of Peking (1860), and the Treaty of Tarbagatai (1864), China had to surrender nearly 350,000 square miles of territory to Russia, as well as giving the Russians special trading privileges and the right to station consuls in the area. At the same time, China suffered massive territorial losses to the Russians in Manchuria.China's weakened state as a result of the Taiping Rebellion (1850-64), the second Opium War (1857-60), and Muslim Rebellions in Yunnan (1855-1873) and Shaanxi (1862-1873) set the stage for the next phase in the Game. Between 1864 and 1877, the Muslims in Sinkiang revolted and set up an independent state, which came to be known as 'Kashgaria,' under the leadership of the Kokand adventurer Yaqub Beg, who attempted to maintain good relations with both Britain and Russia, in hopes that they would be able to protect him against the inevitable Chinese attempt to once again bring the area and its inhabitants under the control of the Qing dynasty. Under these unstable conditions, the Russians proceeded to annex the Ili Valley in 1870-71, giving as their reason the need to maintain law and order in this area adjacent to their newly-conquered territory in Russian Turkestan. In 1877, Yaqub Beg was defeated by the Chinese general Zuo Zongtang. However, the 'Ili Crisis' lasted until 1881, when the Treaty of St. Petersburg was signed, resulting in the return of most of the annexed territory to China, although Russia kept some of it and China had to pay indemnities to her and allow her to open up more consulates in the area. In 1884, Sinkiang officially became a province of China. However, the strive for independence remained, and in 1933 an Independent Republic of Eastern Turkestan was formed in Kashgar.';;;;;;;;;;X

Many territorial claims in Malaysia still remained to be settled, however. With France brought to its knees by Germany, Siam would use Japanese mediation to regain territory which had been ceded to France in 1893, including western Cambodia and all of Laos west of the Mekong River. Just hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Siam granted Japan the right to cross through the country on their way to the Malaysian frontier. Siam was now, effectively, an ally of the Japanese Empire, a fact that would be made official in a matter of weeks.;;;;;;;;;;x

SCH_DESC;The Swiss Confederation saw crisis in 19th century. In several cantons liberal powers prevailed, calling for more democracy and more centralism. This met the opposition of the catholic, conservatively dominated cantons who formed the Sonderbund in 1845. The Sonderbund War erupted in 1847 which saw the liberals as victors. In 1848 a Federal Constitution was ratified, turning the loose league of cantons into a Federal Stae with a new federal capital in Bern. The new constitution created new institutions like the (Bundesrat) Federal Council, Bundesversammlung (Federal Assebly), and Bundesgericht (Federal Court). Switzerland remained neutral during World War I, although there were various domestic conflicts between German and French speaking Swiss citizens. In addition economical problems arose, completely surrounded as the country was by warring nations. The radical left gained a lot of support during that time, and in 1918 a strike called for by the workers movement attempted to push through major social changes. The attempt failed, but in its wake social reforms were begun, bringing about higher wages and shorter work days. In 1919 the system of proportional representation was introduced. The conservative Freisinnige lost their majority while the social democrats grew stronger. Into the 1930s the domestic politics were governed by the conflict between social democrats and conservatives. Switzerland joined the LEague of Nations in 1920 despite the resistance efforts by conservatives and Swiss friendly towards Germany. The integral, unconditional neutrality was replaced by the differentiating neutrality. The London Declaration permitted Switzerland to deny the support of military sanctions.;;;;;;;;;;x

SAU_DESC;The center of the Arabian Peninsula became the starting point for the Wahhabite state in 1744. Fo Muhammad ibn Abd-al Wahh�b both the Shiite Islam of the Ottoman Empire and the Sunnite Islam of the Persians distortions of the true Muslim faith. In alliance with Muhammad Ibn Saud the Wahhabites conquered all the tribes of Arabia in an offensive that would last decades. After the death of Abd-al Wahh�b the Saudis ruled the larger part of the peninsula, conquering Mekka in 1806 and threatening Syria. Mohammed Ali, Ottoman governor in Egypt crushed the first Saudi state in 1818 by order of the Sultan. But already in 1824 a new principality under Saudi government was forming. The Wahhabiyya remained an important religious and political power in Arabia. In 1843 an attempt to restore the Wahhabite state was foiled by quarrels between tribes and the Ottoman intervention of 1884. The last Saud fled to Kuwait in 1891. From there Aziz ibn Saud (1902 - 1953) managed to found a new Wahhabite country. 1902 he conquered Ryad and made her his capital. He had to submit to an Ottoman military expidition in 1905, but he kept the status of a vassall. In the Saudi-Ottoman treaty of 1914 he received the province of Nadshd as hereditary property After the British-Saudi protection treaty of 1915 Ibn Saud remained quiet. The active role in the fight against the Turks was taken by the Heshamites of the Hedjaz. Sherif Hussein who proclaimed himself 'King of the Arabian Lands' after the Turkish had been driven from Medina became the main rival in the struggle for power. However, after the World War the Hashemites were expelled from the Hedjaz by the Saudis in 1924 and in 1927 Ibn Saud was crowned 'King of Nadshd, Hedjaz, and her Protectorates'. In 1932 he became ruler of the newly founded Saudi-Arabia. Becoming the custodians of the Holy Places of Islam gave the Saudis both an important legitimation of their rulership and high revenues from pilgrimages. However, economic setbacks due to the Great Depression forced the to open their country for U.S. oil concessions. Nevertheless, the oil wells discovered in 1936 would not become economically important until over a decade later.';;;;;;;;;;X

SAL_DESC;Since its declaration of independence from Spain in 1821, El Salvador has been sharply divided between liberal and conservative factions that would leave it as disunited as most of the other Central American states. Despite several abandoned attempts to create a federal state with the other Central American countries, El Salvador has remained independent and easily influenced by foreign powers. Indeed, one of the most powerful influences in its history has been the foreign owned coffee industry. A drastic fall in the price of coffee during the great depression would lead to a minor communist insurrection in 1932. In reaction to this insurrection the military seized power and launched a series of reprisals that would claim the lives of over 20,000 Salvadorans. The new President, General Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez would launch a program that can only be described as limited liberalization combined with absolute repression. Though Martinez would never take on the elites of Salvadoran society, he did institute limited land reform and social welfare. A fervent anti-communist, he was sympathetic to the fascist cause, but also deeply aware that the US is much, much closer. The Generalissimo was also known for his spiritualism, which culminated in his stringing lights through San Salvador in an effort to ward off an epidemic of smallpox.;;;;;;;;;;x

SAF_DESC;For thousands of years South Africa has been populated by two distinct cultural groups: the hunter gatherer San (Bushmen) and the agrarian Khoikhoi (Hottentots). These communities were irretrievably shattered by the arrival, in 1652, of Dutch bases on the cape, which were quickly followed by settlements. The Khoikhoi were soon reduced to forced labor for the settlers and for the Dutch East India Company, with rights often much less than that of slaves in the Americas. After the British took control of the colony during the Napoleonic Wars several attempts were made to alleviate the plight of the Khoikhoi, with limited success. Either way the liberal policies of the British led to large numbers of Dutch Voortrekkers to head north and establish their own republics on still more Khoikhoi land. The interior of South Africa would remain largely unsettled by whites, however, well into the 19th century. This would all change upon the discovery of vast diamond and gold deposits in the area. The influx of British prospectors would soon lead to increasingly violent confrontations between British colonials and Boer Republicans. The period also saw the final, violent repressions of the last remaining free chiefdoms in South Africa. An attempt at a federal system incorporating both the colonies and the Boer republics was shattered by a Boer victory over the British at Majuba in 1881. The resulting Anglo-Boer War, which raged from 1899-1902, would lead to an annexation of the Boer republics. The Boers, however, would win the peace, creating a constitution that ensured the retention of white-only rule in South Africa. White Afrikaners still, however, held a great deal of resentment towards the British Empire. Though an agreement was made with the Crown in 1926 which ensured that South Africa would remain part of the Commonwealth, a great deal of the population still opposes this measure.;;;;;;;;;;x

ROM_DESC;In the Peace of Paris, concluding the Crimean War (1853 - 1856), the unification of Moldavia and Walachia into the Principality Romania was decided. Ioan Alexandru Cuza became the first Prince (1859 - 1866), to be followed onto the throne by Karl von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. (1866 - 1914). After the 8th Russian-Turkish War 1877/78, which saw Romania fighting alongside Russia, the country's sovereignty was recognized on the Berlin Congress 1878. Southern Bessarabia was ceded to Russia, while Romania gained Dobrudja. In 1881 the Romanian Prince took the title of King Karl I. The orientation towards the West was secured, Russian influence lost its appeal. Karl I settled the Second Balkans War (1913) and joined the Calibrater with Dobrudja. His successor Ferdinand (1914 - 1927) became King of All Romanians.  With the outbreak of World War One in 1914 Romania initially remained neutral, but would join the Entente in 1916. The Middle Powers were unable to occupy the country and signed the peace of Bucharest in 1918. With the collapse of the Habsburg and Romanov monarchies saved Romania the ratification of that peace treaty. Romanians in Transsylvania and Bukovina decided on their unification with the Romanian state, an act that was internationally recognized in the Paris Peace Treaties of 1920. Their political ties to the West, however, were thwarted by the state's behavior. After the death of King Ferdinand I, six year old Michael I, whose father Karl II had given up his royal heritage because of an affair with the commoner Elena Lupescu, rose to the throne. In 1930, nevertheless, Karl II returned from Paris to climb the throne. The major powers were having a close watch on the country and her rich oil reserves, however.;;;;;;;;;;x
ROM_41_DESC;In the Peace of Paris, concluding the Crimean War (1853 - 1856), the unification of Moldavia and Walachia into the Principality Romania was decided. Ioan Alexandru Cuza became the first Prince (1859 - 1866), to be followed onto the throne by Karl von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. (1866 - 1914). After the 8th Russian-Turkish War 1877/78, which saw Romania fighting alongside Russia, the country's sovereignty was recognized on the Berlin Congress 1878. Southern Bessarabia was ceded to Russia, while Romania gained Dobrudja. In 1881 the Romanian Prince took the title of King Karl I.

He reigned until 1940 when, as a consequence of the Hitler-Stalin Pact and the Vienna Arbitration, Northwestern Transsylvania went to Hungary, the Northern Bukovina and Bessarabia to Russia, and Southern Dobrudja to Bulgaria. Michael I returned to the throne, but the government appointed General Ion Antonescu as State Leader. In 1941 Romania joined the German attack against the Soviet Union, her troops driving into the Bukovina and Bessarabia.;;;;;;;;;;x

PRU_DESC;Although factually independent since 1821, Spain recognized the autonomy of her former colony not until 1871 when a peace between the countries was struck after a conflict of the two countries over the Chinchain Islands. An alliance with Bolivia drew the country 1879 till 1883 in a border conflict between Chile and Bolivia in the Atacama Desert (Saltpeter War). During the war Peru lost her provinces of Tarapac�, Arica, and Tacna. British and U.S. financial circles exploited the opportunity, stripping the weakened Peruvian state of their state railroad, nullifying Peru's debts in exchange. Between 1895 and 1930 the domestic situation was consolidated. Newly discovered copper deposits made up for the loss of the Saltpeter provinces for which Peru was compensated in the Treaty of Lima 1929, getting free port access to Arica, receiving back the province of Tacna, and 6 million Dollars. With the Great Depression and the subsequent fall of President Legu�as the clmate in domestic plitics grew colder. The socialist APRA (Allianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana, founded in 1924) under Victor Ra�l Haya de la Torre demanded a land reform and the political and social integration of the Indios who made up 50 percent of the population. In 1931 and 1936 Haya de la Torre failed in the elections. The successes of his party, however, alarmed the military under Oscar Raimundo Benavides who banned the party.;;;;;;;;;;x

POR_DESC;Characteristacal for 19th century Portugal were struggles between republicans and supporters of a constitutional monarchy, causing a deep rift in the country. 1910 a coup of Portuguese republican officers against King Emanuel II the rule of the Braganca. Te�filo Fernandes Braga became first president of the republic. He proclaimed the civil liberties and emancipated women in family law. An agricultural reform failed, however, because of the opposition of the aristocracy. The gravest heritage of the republic was the desolate economy which was completely oriented towards trade with Great Britain. The inner conflict caused the quick change of eight presidents and fourty-four governments till 1926. World War 1, which Portugal joined on the side of the Entente, made matters worse. The merchant marine suffered heavy losses from the German U-Boats, and the trade with the colonies collapsed. The situation escalated with two military coup attempts in 1926 during which the republican constitution was abolished. General Ant�nio Oscar de Fragoso Carmona took the reigns of the government and was confirmed in office through elections held in 1928. He founded the Second Republic which he would lead in authoritarian fashion for decades to come. Ant�nio Oliveira Salazar became his minster of finances with many authorizations. In 1932 Salazar became prime minister and established a system after fascist pattern.;;;;;;;;;;x

POL_DESC;Until the end of the Great War, there was no Poland. What had been Polish territory had been carved up between Austria, Russia, and Prussia at the end of the 18th century, and in the face of scattered uprisings throughout the 19th those three nations continued to hold on to their Polish territory. By 1918, however, the Poles found themselves in the uniquely fortuitous position of having all of their former subjugators collapse around them as Russia fell into revolution while Germany and Austria were defeated by the Allies. Not wasting any time, the Polish leader Jozef Pilsudski declared an independent Poland on November 11th 1918, and after a bitter war to hold off the newly formed Soviet state, Poland was officially a free nation. Though it had lost it's Democratic regime to a coup in 1926, Poland was prospering by 1936, with the standard of living improving, unemployment falling, and the economy recovering nicely. Yet, Poland's fate seems increasingly uncertain as it finds itself sandwiched between Soviet Russia and a resurgent Germany, both of which would enjoy seeing Poland disappear from the map.;;;;;;;;;;X

PHI_DESC;The Phillipines had not achieved full independence from American control in 1936, but they were closer to it. The Tydings-McDuffie Act had been passed in 1934, creating the Commonwealth of the Phillipines with an elected government under Manuel Quezon and a constitution based upon that of the United States. While technically an independent state, the United States retained control of the foreign affairs and military until the official date of July 4th 1946, when the Commonwealth of the Phillpines would become the Republic of the Phillipines and achieve true independence. Yet, though they could not be seen quite so clearly at the start of 1936, storm clouds were building and the status of the Phillipines as an American protectorate could have dire consequences for the country's future....  ;;;;;;;;;;X

PER_DESC;For nearly two centuries Persia, known to its people as Iran, has been precariously balanced between conflicting forces. Internally the elements of reform and westernization conflict with an increasingly conservative clergy. Internationally Persia was split, in 1907, into a Russian northern sphere and a British south, although it would never be a formal colony of either power. After several attempts at a constitutional monarchy in the first decades of the 20th Century, Persia was thrown into social, political, and economic chaos. Reza Khan, an army officer, finally staged a successful coup against the corrupt Qajar Dynasty in 1921. Though the intent was originally to proclaim a republic, pressure from the conservative clergy (who feared being left out of any republican power structure) convinced now Prime Minister Reza Khan to crown himself Reza Shah Pahlavi. Strongly authoritarian and nationalistic, Reza Shah soon began a vigorous program of industrialization and secular reform, establishing universities, improving infrastructure, establishing public education, and reducing the influence of the mullahs, thereby laying the foundations for a modern, secular Iranian state. Just as important as modernization and secularizing, however, was his determination that Persia maintain its independence in the face of Soviet expansion and British interests in his country's oil reserves. Perhaps the solution is a third force which could free Persia from Soviet and British influence?;;;;;;;;;;x

In 1937 Persia entered into a regional alliance known as the Saadabad Pact along with other neutral countries of the region, namely Turkey, Iraq, and Afghanistan. With the outbreak of hostilities in Europe the new Trans-Iranian railway could be a tempting target for the allies, should the Soviet Union ever be in need of supply.;;;;;;;;;;x

PAR_DESC;Dictator Jos� Gasparo Rodriguez (1811/14 - 1840) preserved Paraguay's integrity against Argentinian and Brazilian claims through a self-suffcient economy and cutting offhis country politically. His nephew and successor, Carlos Antonio L�pez (1844 - 1862) opened the country again to promote the economic and cultural development. Under his son, Francisco Solano L�pez (1862 - 1870), these efforts ended abruptly when he attempted to secure access to a port militarily. This led to the devastating war against the Triple Alliance of Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay (1865 - 1870) in which Paraguay lost a quarter of her territor and more than half its population. After the death of L�pez in 1870 the national assembly enacted a liberal constitution. 1887 saw the establishing of the Liberal Party and the conservative Asociaci�n Nacional Republicana (Colorado). After permanent revolts and coup d'�tats the situation calmed under Eligio Ayala (1924 - 1928). After the costly Chaco War against Bolivia (1932 - 1935) which gave the larger part of the Chaco Boreal to Paraguay a number of authoritarian regimes ruled the country.;;;;;;;;;;x

PAN_DESC;The history of the nation of Panama is irretrievably linked with its most famous feature: the Panama Canal. After the Columbian government resisted American attempts to build a canal through the Panamanian Isthmus, the United States encouraged the Panamanians to rise up against the Columbians then prevented the Columbians from crossing into Panama to put the insurrection down. The Panamanian declaration of independence was written in New York City and created Panama as a de-facto protectorate of the United States. Suffering, as most Western countries, from the Great Depression, Panamanian objections to non-canal related American commerce in the Canal Zone putting native industry out of business led to a new treaty in early 1936. The new treaty would lessen the United States' special rights in the Canal Zone, while still allowing for unilateral military action on the part of the United States in Panama if the United States found it necessary. While still firmly in the grip of the United States, these measures may not be able to still the budding tides of Panamanian anti-Yankee nationalism.;;;;;;;;;;x

OMN_DESC;When Ahmad Al Bu Sa'id rose to power in 1749, Oman began an age of expansion. For about a hundred years Great Britain tolerated their sea trading empire which reached from the coasts of East Africa as far as China. Slave trading and the export of spices were the primary sources of income. Between 1789 and 1805 rivalries for the throne between factions within the Al Sa'id Dynasty preluded Oman's deminse. More and more it came under the influence of the British Empire without ever becoming a formal colony. During this feud, Muscat on the sea formed a sultanate while the inner country became a relgiously oriented imamate. The growing dominance of the British increased the political and economic dependency of Oman. Not only had they lost the rich island of Sansibar to the British, in exchange for which they recieved the Sansibar Subsidy, but the opening of the Suez Canal and the prohibition of slave and weapons trade had completely crippled their economy.;;;;;;;;;;X

NZL_DESC;New Zealand was granted its dominion status in 1907, and since then has remained linked closely both with it's mother country Britain and it's larger neighbor Australia. In fact, New Zealand's experiences mirrored those of Australia in many ways, New Zealanders served in the ANZAC (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps), and fought with great distinction from Flanders to Gallipoli to Egypt and Turkey. As a result, they took disproportionate casualties for such a small nation, with over 18,000 of an original overseas force of 100,000 killed in action. Nevertheless, they earned a reputation for ferocity in battle which has never faded. By the 1930's, the Great Depression hit New Zealand's economy hard, with export prices plummeting and lay-offs souring. By 1935, despite the best efforts of the National Party to remedy the situation, New Zealand's economy was in shambles and the Labor party was brought to power as a result. New Zealand is by no means ready for war in 1936, but if it comes, like her larger neighbor, her soldiers can be counted on to support Britain.;;;;;;;;;;x
NZL_41_DESC;By 1941, the soldiers of New Zealand have fought alongside their Australian comrades throughout the Mediterranean, first facing defeat in Greece and Creek, then a brief taste of victory in North Africa, followed by more defeat at the hands of Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps. The Anzacs have fought bravely, but the German army has so far outfought and outmaneuvered the soldiers of the British Commonwealth, and now they must find adapt if they are to turn the tide of the war. The entry of Japan into the conflict has put a new spin on New Zealand's war, for the first time, the island nation is itself threatened with potential invasion, should Japan's campaign succeed in pushing the Allies back through the South Pacific. With the sinking of Force Z, Britain's navy strength is crippled, and so far the Japanese have made stunningly rapid advances down the Malayan peninsula. Whatever the troubles of Europe may have been previously, New Zealand may be about to discover that this is indeed a world at war....;;;;;;;;;;x

Public works projects were started and Farmers were guaranteed a certain minimum price for their goods in an effort to re-stimulate the economy. Yet, the effects of the depression still lingered when war is declared on September 3rd 1939. Though lacking the enthusiasm that characterized it's entry into World War I, New Zealand entered the war on Britain's side at once, the only question now is when the Anzacs will arrive to bolster Britain's war effort.;;;;;;;;;;x

NOR_DESC;For centuries Norway had been part of the Danish realm until Denmark had to cede - without Iceland or Greenland - it to Sweden in the Peace of Kiel. An attempt of the Norwegians to proclaim independence from their Swedish neighbour was foiled by a military intervention by King Karl XIII. However, the Swedish king allowed his new subjects internal autonomy by recognizing their constitution. Tensions between the parliament (Storting) and the king in Sweden escalated in the 1870. Under leadership of the liberal left (Venstre) the country turned into parliamentary monarchy in 1884 with universal suffrage after 1898 (till 1913 only for men). With Norway's rise as a trading power in the 19th century came claims to install consulates in other countries. Resistance by Sweden against this claim caused the end of the Union between the countries in 1905. The Danish prince Karl was elected King Haakon VII. Despite British demands Norway remained neutral during World War I, even though it lost half its merchant marine to Germany's unrestricted U-Boat warfare. In 1920 the League of Nations awarded Spitzbergen to Norway despite Russian claims to the islands. The transition of from an agricultural country to a modern industrial state brought with it inflation and unemployment after The Great War, leading to a radicalization of the Worker's Party which had been founded in 1887. In 1923 a Communist Party was formed, and in 1933 appeared the fascist party Nosjonal Samling under leadership of Vidkun Quisling.;;;;;;;;;;x

NEP_DESC;After successful campaigning against Tibet in the late 18th century, the ruling Gurkhas in Nepal were shown their limits when their attacks on British India between 1814 and 1816 led to them having to recognize a factual British protectorate over their territory. A permanent Resident of the British Crown was sent to Nepal after the Peace of Segauli, and he remained in there till 1923. In return, the British acknowledged the today still valid borders of Nepal and the rule of the Gurkhas. From 1850 on Nepal provided the British Colonial Army with the famous Gurkha regiments who were first employed during the Sepoy Uprising in 1857. Gurkhas also fought along British troops during World War 1 and the relationships between the two countries were tightened with a treaty of friendship in 1923. The domestic politics after 1775 were dominated by power struggles between the kings and the nobility. Three underage kings in a row (1775 till 1832) who were dominated by aristocratic families vying for power additionally weakened the Shah Dynasty. The most influential family were at first the Thapa (1806 - 1837) before the Rana family prevailed. 1846, after the king's nephew, Jang Bahadur Rana (1846 - 1877), had massacred the opposition on Kot Square, the Rana family took power for the following 104 years, making the office of Prime Minister hereditary, reducing the king's power to a minimum.;;;;;;;;;;X

MON_DESC;Stuck between the gigantic empires of Russia and China, the land of Genghis Khan has long had to struggle for its independence. Though freed from Chinese rule following the collapse of the ruling Manchu dynasty in 1911, Mongolia's independence was not recognized by the new Republic of China, and therefore Mongolia increasingly turned to Russia for its continued survival. Yet, the unexpected Russian Revolution of 1917 placed Mongolia in a vulnearable position, with the Russian Civil War soon spilling over the border into its protectorate. After suffering from an invasion by a Chinese warlord army, a counter-invasion by White Russian forces under Baron Roman Nicolaus von Ungern-Sternberg, an uprising by the Mongolian Partisan Army of Sukhe Bator, and finally a coup that toppled the old Monarchy entirely, Mongolia emerged as the second Communist state in the world and the Soviet Union's only ally, though under tight Soviet control. Though finally stable by 1924, Mongolian history was henceforth to reflect all the tragedies that consumed their larger neighbor to the north. Purges were conducted throughout the 1920's to rid the country of 'capitalist' elements, Buddhist monks and religion were actively suppressed, and the power of the old feudal lords was destroyed. By 1936, however, the Socialist revolution is being tuned down in the face of a new threat from an expansionist Japan. The task now is to militarily prepare for the day, should it come, that Japan decides to add Mongolia to its growing empire.;;;;;;;;;;x

By the late 1930's, however, the Socialist revolution was being tuned down in the face of a new threat from an expansionist Japan. While defeated at Khalkhyn Gol, the Japanese remainded defiant. Their newly launched campaign into the South Pacific leaves room for hope that Mongolia might remain neutral in the war raging around it, but the precarious state of the Soviet Union by late 1941 leaves little room for optimism. Should the Soviet Union fall, it's very likely Mongolia will fall as well without it's protector.;;;;;;;;;;x

By 1939, however, the Socialist revolution is being tuned down in the face of a new threat from an expansionist Japan. The start of fighting between the Japanese Kwangtung Army and the Soviets along the Khalkhyn Gol river in May has dragged Mongolia into the fighting on the side of the Soviets, but the battle now seems to be winding down to a decisive Soviet victory and Japan is retreating to lick its wounds. At present, the country appears to be safe.;;;;;;;;;;x

MEX_DESC;Wracked by years of revolution, rebellion, and repeated coups against corrupt governments, Mexico was finally on the path to recovery. Under the control of Plutarco El�as Calles in fact if not in name for the past decade, Mexico had gained a stable but corrupt government under the National Revolutionary Party, whose successive presidents were almost completely under Calles' thumb. By 1934, the increasingly conservative Calles was forced to make concessions to left-wing members of his party by agreeing to the nomination of L�zaro C�rdenas as the NPR's canditate for the presidency. It was to prove a fateful choice, C�rdenas was a scrupulously honest politician who refused to be controlled, and disputed with Calles on numerous issues. By the beginning of 1936, the political environment was growing increasingly volatile between the former strong man and this new rival for power. The only question was who would make the first move......;;;;;;;;;;X

MAN_DESC;The Manchu dynasty ruled China until the revolution in 1911 caused the abdication of the final Manhurian Emperor Hsuan T'ung. In 1931, Chinese Nationalists began to challenge the growing influence over Manchuria that the Japanese had been exerting.  In response the Kwangtung Army occupied Manchuria.  In 1932 Japan declared that the region, would be an independent Manchu state, named Manchukuo.  The final Manchu Dynasty emperor, now called K'ang Te was installed as emperor of Manchukuo in 1934.  The Japanese millitary maintained tight control of Manchukuo and few foriegners were allowed into the nation, while the Japanese greatly expanded the regions industrial capacity;;;;;;;;;;x

LUX_DESC;The Vienna Congress 1814/15 proclaimed Luxemburg a Grand Duchy and made it part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Dutch King, was, as Grand Duke of Luxemburg at the same time member of the German League. After the Belgian independence in 1831 had to grant its wallonic territories to Belgium by rule of the London Protocol of 1839. The Dutch attempts to sell the Grand Duchy to the French after the end of the German League 1866 caused the Luxemburg Crisis which ended when the small country was formally granted its independence and neutrality. The personal union with the Netherlands ended in 1890 with the death of Wilhelm III, the last male heir of the house Orania-Nassau. The Salian law of Luxemburg did not allow for female heirs to the crown. During World War 1 Germany did not observe the neutrality of the country, occupying the Grand Duchy.;;;;;;;;;;x

LIT_DESC;As the power of Czarist Russia dwindled, Lithuania slowly made steps towards independence. In 1905/07 they recieved partial autonomy and called for a constitutional assembly. During World War 1 the country was occupied by the Germans, and, after successful Russian Revolution declared independence in 1918 as a democratic republic. This caused the Red Army to march into Vilnius to bring the young state back into Russia, but the intervention of German and Polish troops preserved Lithuania's integrity. Poland nevertheless annexed Vilnius during the Russian-Polish War of 1920. This annexion was recognized by a referendum in 1922. In 1923 Lithuania annexed the Memel area which had till 1919 been under Prussian rule and had been under administration by the Allies since then. The conference of the Allies' ambassadors acknowledged the annexion but insisted of internal autonomy for the region. The time after The Great War was marked by internal crisis in Lithuania. The government decided a land reform in 1922, taking land from the big landowners and robbing them also fo their political and economical leadership. Social tension kept increasing and thus permitted the toppling of the government in 1926 by the army and the right-wing Tautinenkae party. The republican constitution was repealed and an authoritarian regime under Antanas Smetona was installed. In 1934, the Baltic Entente was formed with Latvia and Estonia.;;;;;;;;;;x

LIB_DESC;Created in the early 19th century by freed African-Americans who either wanted to return to Africa to start a new life or were forced to leave, Liberia was to eventually earn the honor, alongside Ethiopia, of being the only independent countries in Africa. Since their declaration of independence from the Great Britain in 1846, Liberia has dealt peacefully with several border conflicts over the years with both France and Britain. The twentieth century has seen for Liberia many years of tension between the African-American colonists and the indigenous peoples of the area, with an international commission from the League of Nations investigating charges of slavery and forced labor in 1929. In the coming conflict Liberia will be an important part of the Allied war effort, as its rubber supply could be vital;;;;;;;;;;x

LDESC_TRANSPORT_PLANE;Transport Planes are designed to ferry men and materials over long distances to where they are needed quickly. Paratroopers rely on Transport Planes in order to reach their objective and to keep resupplied from the air.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_TRANSPORT;Naval Transports are important for moving supplies and resources around the world. They can also be used to ferry land units across stretches of water. They are completely unarmed however, and unless well protected will be vulnerable to attack by other naval units or aircraft.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_TORPEDO_PLANE;Torpedo Planes are designed primarily to support warships in naval combat. They are designed to carry a torpedo and launch it into the water, aimed at a capital ship. Due to the size and weight of the torpedo, the planes that carry them can be slow and unwieldy, making them easy prey for fighters and anti-aircraft fire.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_TACTICAL_BOMBER;Tactical Bombers are a medium sized aircraft, larger than fighters, yet smaller than Strategic Bombers, which are used primarily for delivering attacks against enemy ground units such as Armour and Infantry.  Although they have a limited dog-fighting capability, they can be easily outmatched by fighters in air combat.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_SUBMARINE;The Submarine is designed to travel underwater allowing it to operate clandestinely against other naval units. Its main armament consists of torpedos which can be deadly against all other types of vessel, be it Carrier, Battleship, Naval Transport or another Submarine. However, the Submarine can be handicapped by a short range and new thechnologies to improve them can be expensive.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_STRATEGIC_BOMBER;Strategic Bombers are the heaviest of the aircraft types and are designed to deliver a large payload of bombs to enemy provinces, with the aim of crippling his industry and infrastructure. However, the Strategic Bomber is slow despite its long range, which can leave it vulnerable to attack by fighters.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_PARATROOPER;Paratroopers are one of the elite branches of the Infantry, who are specifically trained to either paradrop to the ground or be ferried to a battleground in gliders. Their rapid deployment capability makes them ideal for use as a mobile reserve, or for use in capturing a strategic asset behind enemy lines. However, they are handicapped by a lack of heavy equipment due to their mode of travel, and when they are in action it is advisable to move other units to their support.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_PANZER;Armoured units allow real projection of power on the battlefield. Their speed and firepower make them lethal against all but the best entrenched Infantry. However, as tanks became heaver, their speeds would reduce accordingly.  They also required a constant supply of fuel to remain in the field, and if this vital supply was severed, the armoured unit would be next to useless.;;;;;;;;;;x
LDESC_NAVAL_BOMBER;The Naval Bomber is only marginally larger than a Fighter aircraft. It is designed to work in close cooperation with naval units and provide pin point tactical strikes against enemy surface vessels. They have a limited dog-fighting capability, which can leave them vulnerable if intercepted by fighters.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_MOTORIZED;Motorized Infantry make use of wheeled vehicles, such as trucks, to manoeuvre more rapidly than basic Infantry. But they are limted to the use of roads, and their performance may suffer in provinces with low infrastructure levels.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_MILITIA;Militia are a cheap and rapidly formed Infantry unit. Their hurried training and poor equipment mean they are of little use in combat, although they can be useful for controlling territory and as a last line of defence when no other units are available.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_MECHANIZED;Mechanized Infantry are equipped with all-terrain vehicles, such as the halftrack, which does not limit them to roads as with Motorized Infantry and allows them to work well with armoured units. However, the specialist equipment they require, means their cost is high as a result.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_MARINE;Marines are one of the elite branches of the Infantry, who are specifically trained for assaulting beaches and other naval operations. They make use of specialised equipment and tactics to give them an edge over regular Infantry in such an environment.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_INFANTRY;Infantry will most likely make up the bulk of your armies. They are relatively cheap to build and require no regular fuel supply to manoeuvre, but their lack of motorized transportation means their speed of advance is limited. However, Infantry are able to occuply large areas of land, securing ground captured by other arms of your forces.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_FLYING_ROCKET;The Flying Rocket (the equivalent of the German V2) was designed to deliver a payload of explosives to a non-specific target. Its high speed made it practically impossible to intercept, but its low payload meant that it made more of a psychological impact than a destructive one.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_FLYING_BOMB;The Flying Bomb (the equivalent of the German V1) is basically a pilotless aircraft powered by an early rocket engine, designed to deliver a payload of explosives to a non-specific target. It is slower than the Flying Rocket, which means that in some cases it can be intercepted and shot down by enemy fighters.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_FIGHTER;Fighters are light aircraft designed primarily for combatting other fighter aircraft and enemy bombers. They are smaller and more agile than bombers, which means that for bombers to stand any chance of survival against fighters, they must have their own escort of these type of craft.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_ENGINEER;Engineer Brigades will increase the ability of the unit they are attached to when crossing rivers, making the process quicker and reducing disorganisation.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_DIVE_BOMBER;The Dive Bomber is only marginally larger than a Fighter aircraft. It is designed to work in close cooperation with ground units and provide pin point tactical strikes to aid in disorganising enemy forces. They have a limited dog-fighting capability, which can leave them vulnerable if intercepted by fighters.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_DESTROYER;The Destroyer is the smallest and the fastest of the surface ships. It is lightly armed in comparison with the battleship, but its speed and manuevrabilty allows it to provide a good first line of defence away from the main capital ships of a fleet, and its light guns are useful for targetting threats from the air. Destroyers are usually combined in groups, and used for convoy escort and anti-submarine duties.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_CRUISER;The Cruiser is primarily used as a hunting ship, to search for, and destroy enemy shipping. They are smaller, and less heavily armed than Battleships, but they make up for these deficiencies in speed.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_CAVALRY;Cavalry are able to move fairly rapidly over most types of terrain, and do not require a supply of fuel to operate, but they are lightly armed when compared with Armoured units, and the advanced weapons of the time can inflict devastating casualties to both men and horses. That is not to say that Cavalry can't prove useful in some instances as a mobile reserve.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_CARRIER;The Aircraft Carrier is rapidly becoming the most important naval vessel. Its ability to project power through the aircraft it carries makes it dangerous to other capital ships and land forces. However, the ship itself is only lightly armed, and must rely on other naval units, as well as its own aircraft, to afford it protection.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_BERGSJAEGER;Mountain Troops are one of the elite branches of the Infantry, who are specifically trained for operations in mountainous provinces.  They make use of specialised equipment and tactics to give them an edge over regular Infantry in such an environment.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_BATTLESHIP;The Battleship is the Queen of the Sea. It is a massive floating gun platform, designed primarily to engage enemy capital ships at long range and send them to the bottom of the ocean. However, they remain vulnerable to air or submarine torpedo attacks, and the advent of the Aircraft Carrier has started to number their days.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_ARTILLERY;Artillery pieces will increase the 'Soft Attack' attributes of your units, inflicting more damage on Infantry and Motorized units.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_ANTITANK;Anti-Tank weapons will increase the 'Hard Attack' attributes of your units, inflicting more damage on Armoured and Mechanized units.;;;;;;;;;;X

LAT_DESC;During World War 1 German troops occupied Latvia, then part of Czarist Russia, and German plans of annexing the country led to anti-German sentiments. Nevertheless, when Latvian Bolsheviks attempted to re-integrate the state into the newly Founded Soviet Union, German free corps helped defending the young country's independence in 1918. After the external threat was over, the eternal conflict between Latvians and Baltic Germans who were making up a notable part of the upper class flared up again. Eventually, the Germans were dispossessed of their belongings in 1922, breaking the predominance of the old elites. After Hitler's rise to office in 1933 Latvia found herself between two expansionist powers. With Estonia and Lithuania the Baltic Entente was formed in 1934. The former leader of the independence movement, Karlis Ulmanis, began turning Latvia into a dictatorship in 1936.;;;;;;;;;;x

JAP_DESC;The only non-western country to successfully negotiate the transition from a traditional economy and society to an advanced industrial nation-state, Japan did well out of the First World War, occupying the former German Pacific island chains and clearly advancing its claim to be the preeminent power in Asia. But financial misfortunes during the 1920s destabilized Japan�s civilian parliamentary government, and led the way for a series of bloody coups and assassinations by extreme nationalist military leaders. An increasing concern at the country�s poor raw materials base, essential for the subjugation of further colonial territory, led the military to attack Manchuria in 1931 � part of Japan�s long-standing aim of achieving hegemony over China. This brought material rewards but also loud complaints from the western democracies, which now seemed increasingly hostile towards Japan�s strategic goals. Japan in 1936 stands at a crossroads with many options but no straightforward path. Should it press ahead with a full-scale assault on China, regardless of how vast a task that might be? Is an offensive against Soviet Siberia a better long-term plan? Or how about the oil and rubber-rich provinces of South East Asia? The Americans may prove dangerous foes, they too must be taken into account.;;;;;;;;;;X
JAP_41_DESC;Japan saw the outbreak of the European war as an opportunity in the Pacific. While British, French and Dutch attentions were occupied elsewhere, the Japanese might be able to harvest the rich resources of the colonial empires of South East Asia: badly needed resources like rubber and oil could be found in plenty in Malaya, Indo-China, and the East Indies. Only this way, thought the Japanese military elite now ruling the country, would Japan be able to finally end its sluggish battle of attrition in China and assert its predominance across the eastern world. However, the plan had one chief obstacle: the attitude of the United States. The Roosevelt administration was clearly not prepared to countenance any Japanese actions in SE Asia without a fight, as it proved in 1941 when America embargoed sales of oil in protest at Japan's takeover of Vichy French territory in Vietnam and Cambodia. Only by removing the American military threat, concluded the generals, could Japan be free to act. To this end Japan's most formidable strategic planner, Admiral Yamamoto, forged a scheme to attack the US Pacific Fleet at its Pearl Harbor base, and so damage American confidence that the country would be bound to sue for peace. This attack took place a few days ago, and all reports indicate its almost complete tactical success: but now, with Japanese troops poised to cross enemy borders across Asia, the question remains. Will Japan's great gamble against the overwhelming industrial power of America pay off?;;;;;;;;;;x

Is an offensive against Soviet Siberia a better long-term plan than the Chinese quagmire? Or how about the oil and rubber-rich provinces of South East Asia?

ITA_DESC;Italy entered the First World War with high expectations of gaining territory in the Alps and along the Adriatic shoreline from the Austro-Hungarians, and perhaps taking part in the carve-up of the moribund Ottoman Empire. Its actual performance in that war was disappointing, however, and it received less than expected from the Versailles settlement following the Armistice. This further weakened the country�s already unstable parliamentary democracy and paved the way for Benito Mussolini�s famous �March on Rome� in 1922, which helped establish Europe�s first fascist dictatorship. To help bolster the popularity of his autocratic regime Mussolini was pledged to return Italy to Great Power status, to build up formidable land, sea and air forces, and to expand the Italian colonial empire. In 1936 he is poised to conduct his first major step in this campaign, an offensive against the Abyssinians which will (he hopes) remove the ignominious stain of Italy�s 1898 defeat at Adowa. But this attack is bound to be diplomatically controversial, and it is far from clear whether Italy�s modest industrial resources are capable of extended war. The fate of the Italian fascist experiment is uncertain.;;;;;;;;;;X
ITA_41_DESC;Italy has not had a happy war. In June 1940, flushed with confidence after Germany's rapid success against France and Britain in the Ardennes offensive, Mussolini declared war on the West in the hopes of joining in the rich harvest. But despite France's surrender, Italian victories have been frustratingly few. In North and Eastern Africa a series of initial Italian assaults against British colonial territory were vigorously rebuffed, and Mussolini was forced to request German aid. The daring British attack on the fleet at Taranto set back Italy's hopes of challenging the Royal Navy's maritime supremacy in the Mediterranean. And an abortive attack on Greece was thwarted so effectively by the defenders that Germany had to bail out Italy in the Balkans. Now, with German attentions focused almost exclusively on the Eastern Front, Mussolini must decide how he can remove Italy from the shadow of its larger Axis partner and forge a truly independent military strategy. Italy does have some advantages: the British are weak in Africa and could easily be ejected from Egypt with some tactical skill. The difficulty will be acting before the United States can throw in its weight against Italy's small land, sea and air forces. And the conquered Greek and Yugoslavian provinces remain a hotbed of resistance, a constant security burden for the overstretched Italians.;;;;;;;;;;x

IRQ_DESC;Iraq is a new nation in the world community. Though it broke free from the Ottoman empire in the wake of that empire's collapse following the Great War, the League of Nations disregarded Britain's promised support of Arab independence and assigned large tracts of the Middle East to European mandates. The result was a costly uprising for the British, and a new plan for Britain's new mandate. The British imposed a monarchy, and prepared for the future independence of Iraq, to be ruled by the Hashemite family. However, the state lacked legitimacy, not only was it imposed from outside of the country, it was clearly a British puppet regime which wrote it's constitution according to British 'advice' and drew it's territorial boundaries according to British wishes (and with little regard to tribal or ethnic frontiers.) Nevertheless, it's willingness to cooperate with Britain meant that it was one of the first mandates to end, being granted full sovereignty in 1932 and joining the League of Nations in October of that same year, as well as being one of the founding members of the League of Arab States. By 1936, the regime still faces the problem of legitimacy and there is grumbling amongst the military, but how Iraq will fare in the years to come remains unknown.;;;;;;;;;;x

Yet, in 1936, the instability of the old regime led to a military coup d'etat led by General Bakr Sidqi, placing the military forever after on the Iraqi political scene. Sidqi's government was to be short-lived, due to his brutal excesses, and he was murdered by the military in August 1937. Yet, Iraq's stabilities problems were not over, an Anglophobic Arab nationalist by the name of Rashid Ali Al-Gaylani became prime minister in 1941, and promptly tried to curtail Britain's continued domination of the region by seeking aid from Germany. When ministers still loyal to the British pressed him to resign, yet another coup d'etat was organized, with Al-Gaylani supported by four pro-Axis generals known as the 'Golden Square.' It didn't take Britain long to react, and the short-lived Al-Gaylani regime was toppled within a month by the arrival of British troops, sending Al-Gaylani to exile in Germany. By the end of 1941, Iraq is firmly under British control.;;;;;;;;;;x

IRE_DESC;In mid-19th century the Green Isle was economically weak and easily troubled by crisis. Between 1846 and 1849 the potato harvest had been completely destroyed and a famine ravaged the land, leading to mass immigrtions of Irish to the U.S.A. Gradually, voices grew louder in Great Britain, calling for an independence of Ireland from the British Crown. The Liberal Prime Minister William E. Gladstone initiated the seperation of the island from the Anglican church in 1869 and a land reform in 1870. He failed in his attempts of pushing through a Home Rule for Ireland, however. The political resistance in Ireland kept growing. The Home Rule League and the Irish Land League fought for autonomy as a first step towards independence. In 1914 self government was supposed to commence, but it was delayed with the outbreak of World War 1. The disappointment about this delay culminated - supported by German intelligence - in the suppression of the Easter Uprising. Continued unrests further delayed the way to independence. Ireland, excluding the northern region of Ulster, was awarded the status of Free State in 1921 but kept in bond to the British Crown. A bloody civil war between opponents and supporters of the compromise followed in 1922/23. Only Eamon de Valera managed to cut the last ties to Great Britain from 1932 on.;;;;;;;;;;x

HUN_DESC;Following closely after the armistice of November 1918 a deomcratic national council under Prime Minister Mih�ly Count K�rolyi declared Hungary an independent republic. The neighboring countries, especially Romania and the new Kingdom of Serbs, Slovenes, and Croats, seized the opportunity for territorial conquests. Domestic disputes about the future design of the republic forced the government K�rolyi to resign, and the Socialist Party of Hungary, a coalition of Communists and Social Democrats, took power. Under the leadership of B�la Kun a council republic was established. Their attempts at forced social reforms soon led to violent conflicts, however. With the aid of Czech and Romanian troops the forces of restoration managed to crush the republic within a matter of months, at first leading to 'white terror', costing the lives of many suporters of the political left. The situation remained unclear. After the 1920 elections a constitution containing both autoicratic and parliamentary elements was ratified. The question of whether or not the last Habsburg, Karl IV, was to become KIng of Hungary was solved with a compromise. An administrator was appointed instead of a monarch, with former navy admiral Mikl�s Horthy heeding the call. In the peace treaty of Trianon 1920 Hungary acknowledged formally many territorial claims: the Czechoslovakian for Slovakia, the Romanian for Siebenb�rgen, and the Yugoslavian for Croatia and Slovenia. Hungary had lost 70% of her territory and 65% of her population. Two coup attempts in 1921 to bring Karl IV onto the throne failed while Horthy exploited his position for taking power from the parliament and persecuting democratic forces. To the Great Depression and the social tensions accompanying it Horthy reacted by appointing the ultra conservative Gyula H�mb�s as prime minister (1932 - 1936) who would conduct the conducted Hungary's rapprochement towards Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.;;;;;;;;;;x

Only after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1939 did Hungary achieve minor expansion. In 1940 Hungary joined the Three Powers Pact and in 1941 Honv�d troops participated in the attack on Yugoslavia and later in the assault on the Soviet Union. The country was by then less more than a German puppet, tied into Hitler's war production and effort.;;;;;;;;;;x

HON_DESC;Though once a border territory of the Mayan Empire, Honduras became a colony of Spain by the 1700's, with Britain controlling the Eastern coast (which was seized in order to combat Caribbean piracy). With independence from Spain in 1821 Honduras, like the other nations of Central America, slid into a period of continued unrest. Since the early 1900's, however, foreign fruit companies, particularly the rivals United Fruit and Standard Fruit, have dominated Honduran politics. Their grip over the banana trade, which made up for over two-thirds of Honduran exports, led to the phrase 'Banana Republic' being coined in reference to Honduras. The fall of banana prices during the Great Depression would lead to a period of instability culminating in an insurrection by liberals in protest of the (surprisingly fair) election of the pro-military Tiburcio Car�as Andino. The resulting crackdown would soon put an end not only to those who had risen against Car�as, but also to any form of political dissent. Honduras, like so many other Latin American countries of the period, was now in the hands of a rabidly anti-communist, pseudo-fascist dictator.;;;;;;;;;;x

HOL_DESC;While preserving European neutrality (the struggle against Belgium was declared an internal conflict) the Netherlands faced all the fiercer challenges in their colonies. In 1830 an uprising in Java had to be subdued by force. A war against the Sultanate Ateh, joined by various local princes, erupted on Sumatra in 1873 and could only be ended in 1904. The Cape Province, Ceylon, and the Gold Coast had been lost to Great Britain. In domestic policies an agreement was reached between the crown and the growing liberal movement in 1848. Wilhelm II, under influence by Liberal leader Jan Rudolf Thorbecke, installed a liberl constitution which transformed the country into a parliamentary monarchy. Thorbecke became the first prime minister and fortified the - by the time's standards - modern system of government. Internally, the Netherlands stabilized herself permanently, with only the census based suffrage being a major point of conflict till universal and equal suffrage was intriduced in 1917. Only in 1894 a Social Democratic Party formed which, unlike her European cousins of the time, aimed at reforms and not revolutions. Their strict neutrality qualified the Netherlands as host for the great congresses of 1899 and 1905, during which, among other things, the Den Haag Convention with Respect to the Laws and Customs of War on Land was agreed upon. After the country had preserved its neutrality during World War 1, it was decided upon to install the International Court in Den Haag.;;;;;;;;;;x

HAI_DESC;The nation of Haiti takes its name from the word used by the local Arawak Indians for the island of Hispanola, which they called 'Hayti', or mountainous land. Owned by the French since the 17th century, Haiti became a particularly rich colony noted for its particularly large proportion of slaves to free Frenchmen. In 1791 Haitians launched a successful slave revolt, and by 1804 were the first independent black nation in the New World. Though there quickly arose a class system with a minority of light-skinned, Catholic, French-speaking Haitians ruling over a dark-skinned, voodoo worsiping, Creole-speaking majority, Haiti soon devolved into chaos after its independence. Haiti's first ruler, the 'Emperor' General Dessalines, was assassinated following his rampant abuse of power. In 1844 Haiti split in two, with the Dominican Republic declaring independence from Haiti. Continuing unrest led to the United States sending in the Marines in 1915, who would occupy the country (and give still more power to the lighter skinned Haitians) until their departure in 1934. Upon the Marine's departure there were many more hospitals and schools but the country still dangerously disunited. A vicious power struggle would soon ensue between Catholic Haitians and those Haitians who follow voodoo. Currently the Catholic mulattos have the upper hand, with a mulatto President, Stenio Vincent, who has ruled since the United States' occupation.;;;;;;;;;;x

GUA_DESC;After the liberal revolution of 1871 Justo Rufino Barrios (1873 - 1885) reformed the country politcally and economically. The privileges of the catholic church were largely removed. The Jesuites were expelled, monasteries were secularized, and schools came under state control. State and chruch were seperated, free choice of religion was introduced as well as direct elections. The infrastructure was expanded, bringing economic rise. The export of Cochenille became obsolete with the development of chemical dyes, and so the economy shifted towards coffee and bananas. Soon the coffee trade was under German control, the bananas production under U.S. control. The Indians remained without rights. The properties (ind�genas) were dispossessed to expand the areas for the growth of coffee and bananas. Under General Manuel Estrada Carrera (1899 - 1820), who brought the country closer to the U.S.A., the influence of the United Fruit Company grew. The U.S. companies increasingly meddled with the domestic politics of Guatemala. Conservatives, military, and workers' movement (Movimiento Unionista) opposed this American influence and in 1920 overthrew the Carrera government. Henceforth, the military had great influence on the various short-lived governments who were not able to restrict the influence of United Fruit. Relative stability was only reached under the last of the Caudillos (leader) Jorge Ubico Castaneda who came to power in 1931 and established a repressive regime during the Great Depression. Elections were abolished and opposition parties and unions were banned. Increasing the export of bananas and coffee he tried to strengthen again the hurt economy.;;;;;;;;;;x

GRE_DESC;Greece's independence from Ottoman rule was officially declared in 1829/30, with the Peace of Adrianople, ending the 6th Russian-Turkish War, and the London Protocol. However, the country was not stabilized until the Danish Prince Wilhelm climbed the Greek throne as Georg I in 1863. Under his rule the country became a parliamentary monarchy with limited powers for the monarch. Also in 1863 were brought under Greek rule, in 1881 Thessaly and parts of Epirus. Despite a defeat against the Ottomans in 1897 when Greece supported the Cretan uprising the island could - by pressure of the major powers - jpin the state territory. Macedonia was conquered in the Second Balkans War (1912/13) from Bulgaria, leading to continuously bad relations between the two countries. During World War One King Konstantin I saw to it that his country remained neutral at first, but pressure from the Entente and Prime Minister Eleutherios Venizelos forced him to abdicate in 1917, and Greece joined the war against the Middle Powers. With the occupation of Smyrna 1919, Greece provoked a war against Turkey. A crushing defeat in 1922 was the result, and over a million Greek fled from Asia Minor to the Hellenistic mainland. This intake of people facilitated a land reform that would end the dominance of big landowners. The supporters of Venizelos urged to turn the state into a republic, and indeed succeeded with their effort between 1924 and 1935. In 1935 the royalists prevailed one more time, bringing Georg II back onto the throne. The fascist regime of Ioannis Mataxas from 1936 on would factually leave the king powerless, though.;;;;;;;;;;x

GER_DESC;Germany�s defeat in 1918 ushered in its first democratic government, as well as a legacy of economic misery and irredentist resentment against the �slave treaty� of Versailles. Shorn of its colonies and its Polish provinces, burdened with reparations payments and an artificially weakened army, treated as a pariah state for its alleged responsibility for the war, Germany�s political path throughout the Weimar Republican years was a tragic spiral of violence and extremism. The ascent of Adolf Hitler�s National Socialist Party in 1933 marked a turning point in Germany�s historical development. Representative government, comprehensive civil rights and a free press were quickly swept away by the incoming Nazis, who embarked on an increasingly vicious campaign of repression against the nation�s �undesirables� , Jews, Communists, Trade Unionists, and other opponents of the regime. But Hitler also revitalized Germany�s languishing economy and promised to end the inequities of Versailles. By 1936, Germans wonder what their Fuehrer�s first major step will be on the international stage. The remilitarization of the Rhineland? The long-awaited Anschluss with Austria? A showdown with Czechoslovakia or Poland over their disputed German-majority provinces? Only the enigmatic ruler in Berlin knows for sure.;;;;;;;;;;X
GER_41_DESC;Germany's rapid victory over Poland in September 1939, with the assistance of its temporary Soviet ally, proved the worth of the new 'lightning' armored warfare tactics advanced by innovative military thinkers like Heinz Guderian. During the temporary lull in the fighting, the German High Command adopted an ambitious plan of conquest against France and the Low Countries: instead of beating their heads uselessly against the formidable Maginot defenses or trying a re-run of the 1914 Schlieffen Plan, German forces would break through the weak French positions along the Ardennes forest and attempt a massive encirclement of the northern Anglo-French line. In May 1940 this plan, masterminded by General von Manstein, succeeded beyond anyone's wildest expectations: France surrendered after only six weeks' fighting and the British were forced to evacuate their troops at Dunkirk. This left Germany master of Europe but also left a grand strategic dilemma. The UK was subdued but undefeated, and after the failure of the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain no realistic seaborne invasion could be attempted for some time. Instead, Hitler turned his attention eastwards to the USSR, the natural target for his dreams of pan-European 'Lebensraum'. In June 1941 Operation Barbarossa unleashed a whirlwind of destruction against Stalin's dilapidated army, and as winter arrives the Germans now stand at the gates of Moscow. But can they maintain the offensive in the dreadful Russian weather conditions? And will the USA's entry into the war permanently alter the balance of power in the West before the Germans can return victorious from their Soviet conquests?;;;;;;;;;;x

Can the still-modest German war machine defeat such a formidable array of enemies? Only the enigmatic ruler in Berlin knows for sure.;;;;;;;;;;x

FRA_DESC;France�s manpower losses in the First World War were proportionally larger than those of any other major belligerent, and this demographic catastrophe was reflected in the shortfall of annual army conscripts , the so-called �hollow classes� - of the interwar period. With a revived Germany, a self-aggrandizing Italy, and an increasingly unstable Spain on its borders, France could not afford to accept this military weakness without abandoning its pretensions to Great Power status. To compensate, the nation threw itself into a massive fortified works project on the Franco-German frontier during the early 1930s, and tried to build new diplomatic arrangements with the �little entente� powers of central and eastern Europe. By 1936, this has had mixed results. France�s immediate security problems have been partially resolved by its mighty Maginot Line (but what of the unprotected Belgian border?), and it has warm relations with the Czechs and Poles - and even a developing rapprochement with the Soviet Union. But the Third Republic is a deeply divided nation, with a brittle and unsteady political system, and whether it can still weather a serious challenge for the hegemony of the continent remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;X

FIN_DESC;With the demise of the Russian Czar's powers Finland, having been under her Eastern neighbour's rule since 1808, was granted more autonomy. In 1906 a monocameral parliament was installed along with universal suffrage for men and women alike. The parliament, the first in Europe to have a Social Democratic majority since 1916, exploited Russia's weakness after the February Revolution of 1917 and declared Finland's independence in July of the same year. The declaration of the right of self-determination proclaimed by the new Soviet government during the October Revolution strengthened the Finnish claim for independence. On December 6th, 1917, the proclamation of sovereignty was reoeated and acknowledged by the Soviet rulers in late December. An attempt of Finnish Socialists to seize power in early 1918 caused a bloody civil war in which the White Guards, supported by the German Kaiser, prevailed over the Socialist's Red Guards. After the defeat a Communist Party seperated from the Social Democrats and was declared illegal in 1930 after numerous attempts of insurgence. In 1921 Finland reached its largest expansion when the League of Nations declared the Aland islands Finnish territory. In 1932 the country signed a non-aggression pact with the USSR.;;;;;;;;;;x

The secret protocol of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact from August 1939 declared Finland to be a sphere of interest of the Soviet Union. In November 1939 Stalin launched the Winter War to secure territory for the erection of fortresses to secure Leningrad. Finland held out till 1940, letting the USSR appear as a weak military power before the world. In March 1940, however, Finland agreed to peace talks to avoid engagements of British and French against the Soviets on her soil. The Soviets received parts of Karelia and Eastern Finland, the shores of Lake Ladoga and Hanko. In Fall of 1940 German troops landed in Finland and in 1941 the country joined Nazi Germany in their war against the USSR, hoping to claim back their lost territories.;;;;;;;;;;x

An attempt of Finnish Socialists to seize power in early 1918 caused a bloody civil war in which the White Guards, supported by the German Kaiser, prevailed over the Socialist's Red Guards. After the defeat a Communist Party seperated from the Social Democrats and was declared illegal in 1930 after numerous attempts of insurgence. In 1921 Finland reached its largest expansion when the League of Nations declared the Aland islands Finnish territory. In 1932 the country signed a non-aggression pact with the USSR. The secret protocol of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact from August 1939 declared Finland to be a sphere of interest of the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_4101_DESC;On 12th Dec 1936 Chiang Kai-shek was kidnapped by his mutinous army in Manchuria. Chiang was captured by Generals Chang Hsueh-liang and Yang Hu-cheng, who demanded an end to fighting between Chinese Nationalists (Guomindang) and communists in the face of the Japanese invasion. Chiang was released when the communists announced that they would cooperate with the Guomindang in opposing Japan. For the time being Chiang accepted this fragile truce and unholy alliance but later on with the fall of the Japanese he attacked the communists in full force.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_4100_DESC;In the autumn of 1937, Japanese war planes began bombing Nanking, concentrating their efforts on the downtown areas, which were most densely populated by civilians. As Nanking came under attack, the capital was again moved, this time to Chungking. Knowing that Japanese troops were en route toward the city, the people panicked and tried to flee. On 9th Dec 1937, Japanese ground forces reached Nanking, where they were met with minimal resistance from overwhelmed and fatigued Chinese military units. By 13th Dec, with Japanese troops attacking the city from all angles, the Chinese forces were routed. Fearing the consequences of surrender to the Japanese, Chinese military men donned civilian clothing and retreated into the city. It was on this day that the six-week stretch of atrocities against the civilian population of Nanking began. The news of the massacre soon hit the world and significantly deteriorated Japan�s relations with the Democratic countries of the world.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_3900_DESC;After the German occupation of Denmark in April 1940 British forces swiftly took possession of Iceland to counter a possible threat of a German Invasion. Britain held it with few forces and in early 1941 it was evident that it would be better if the United States took over the watch-keeping. By the summer of 1941, U. S. troops occupied both Greenland and Iceland in the North Atlantic. The U. S. occupation of Greenland was arranged through an agreement between the United States government and a rebellious Danish Ambassador in Washington. This Danish Ambassador refused to recognize or obey the Danish government in Copenhagen after the German occupation of Denmark, which began in April of 1940. The Greenland Agreement, signed in April of 1941, encountered vigorous protests from both the Danish government and the German Embassy in Washington.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_3801_NAME;The USA Assassinates Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_3801_DESC;Admiral Yamamoto commanded the Combined Fleet before the outbreak of the Pacific War and during its first sixteen months. He was responsible for planning the Attack on Pearl Harbor and most other major operations during this time. His scheme for eliminating the U.S. fleet as a major opponent led to the June 1942, Battle of Midway in which the Japan lost naval superiority in the Pacific. Despite Midway's adverse outcome, Yamamoto continued as Combined Fleet commander through the following Guadalcanal Campaign, which further depleted Japan's naval resources. One of the great advantages that the United States enjoyed in its war with Japan was the cracking of the Japanese code. This gave the U.S. advanced warning of impending Japanese operations. One such operation was a visit by Admiral Yamamoto to the Japanese base on Bougainvillea. Allied intelligence intercepted and decoded a message describing the visit, and the 13th Air Force decided to welcome him. Even the highest ranking American military commanders felt that to give a direct order to assassinate an enemy commander was above them, and the authorization for the mission eventually came all the way down from the office of the American presidency. On 18th April,1943, one year to the day after the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, 18 American P-38s from the 13th Air Force launched from Guadalcanal, flew to Bougainvillea, found the Admiral's flight, and shot down his plane killing him.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_3800_NAME;US Oil Embargo;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_3800_DESC;In July 1941, the U.S. threatened Japan with an oil embargo unless Japan withdrew from China. Rather than withdraw from China and abandon its imperialist aspirations, Japan chose to attack the U.S. while it still had the oil reserves needed to wage war. Although the U.S. was also pursuing various deterrence strategies against Japan, the threat of an oil embargo was a more ambitious strategy of coercive diplomacy. The threat of embargo was intended not to deter Japan from taking some considered action, but to compel them to withdraw from a current activity. There were a number of reasons why coercive diplomacy not only failed, but actually provoked war in this case. First, U.S. officials failed to recognize that Japan had more at stake in the matter than did the U.S. As the situation progressed, the U.S. sharpened its demands, which in turn sharpened Japan's resistance. Second, the U.S. strategy relied almost entirely on threats, and made very little use of incentives. This left Japan to choose among almost equally unacceptable options. Finally, misperceptions, miscalculations and ambiguous signals between the U.S. and Japan contributed to the escalation of the conflict.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_3718_DESC;In an effort to meet the Fascist threat the United States mobilized much of its manpower and industry. However, as the Allies failed to win on the battlefield losses in lives grew. Further the United States had to shoulder the ever increasing burden of feeding and equipping her so called allies, inefficient and incompetent as they were. To pursue the war as eficiently as possible the US administration issued the US Rationing Act, the US Maximum Wage Act and the US Workforce Registration Act. US workers now had as much freedom in the labour market as their German counterparts. Slowly the tension increased as Labour Unions started to crave their 'human rights'. At first the administration let them be but as major strikes set in police were ordered onto the streets to force labour back to work. Several unionist leaders where tried and executed for treason. On 1st May the Major Trade Unions and the small Socialist and Communist parties peacefully marched to Washington from a number of East Coast cities. In the city riots started and a major fight between protesters and police forced the government to use the closest Infantry Division to restore order. However the young soldiers refused to fire at the mob and leaders of the leftist parties managed to organize the protesters into bands disarming the soldiers and themselves taking up arms against what they took as a govenrment of crooks and thieves. When the capital was secured the leftist parties quickly got control of the chain of command of the administration and organised a new force of Armed Worker's Brigades. An incessant fighting started with local patriots, but in the end the new leftist government prevailed.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_3717_DESC;The dominant issue was the failing US economy. The President had abandoned parts of the New Deal programs, and the US economy was in a recession. Smith started out attacking the administration for abandoning the New Deal and reinventing the catastrophes of the Hoover administration. President Landon started out ignoring his opponents but as the campaign went on and Smith was surging in the polls Landon became more active and suggested that the elderly Smith suffered from a heart condition and was unsuited to be elected as President. This started a major medical debate where certain senators implied that Landon must have been lying to the public as several independent medical examinations showed that Smith had no health problems. Landon never managed to free himself of the accusations of having lied even if he made a national adress repeting and explaining that he had never said that he knew anything of Smith's health specifically.

The Republican President, who was pressed by the unemployment figures promised to resurrect certain New Deal programs, such as Social Security, but lamasted the Democratic Party for being what he called a wasteful and immature party. Smith immediately pointed out that it was all well that the current administration wanted to issue his policies, but that he recommended the voter's to vote for a real Democrat rather than a Republican with Democratic policies. The President though managed to get through his message that the election was about maturity and responsibility and that he both cut unemployment and and balance the budget something his opponent would not be able to do.

Dewey promised to build on some New Deal programs, such as Social Security, but lamasted the administration for being what he called the most wasteful and incompetent administration in the nation's history. The Democrats pointed out that Dewey lacked foreign policy experiences and that it was bad to change horses in midstream. The last point got through.

EVT_3704_DESC;Admiral Yamamoto commanded the Combined Fleet before the outbreak of the Pacific War and during its first sixteen months. He was responsible for planning the Attack on Pearl Harbor and most other major operations during this time. His scheme for eliminating the U.S. fleet as a major opponent led to the June 1942, Battle of Midway in which the Japan lost naval superiority in the Pacific. Despite Midway's adverse outcome, Yamamoto continued as Combined Fleet commander through the following Guadalcanal Campaign, which further depleted Japan's naval resources. One of the great advantages that the United States enjoyed in its war with Japan was the cracking of the Japanese code. This gave the U.S. advanced warning of impending Japanese operations. One such operation was a visit by Admiral Yamamoto to the Japanese base on Bougainvillea. Allied intelligence intercepted and decoded a message describing the visit, and the 13th Air Force decided to welcome him. Even the highest ranking American military commanders felt that to give a direct order to assassinate an enemy commander was above them, and the authorization for the mission eventually came all the way down from the office of the American presidency. On 18th April,1943, one year to the day after the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, 18 American P-38s from the 13th Air Force launched from Guadalcanal, flew to Bougainvillea, found the Admiral's flight, and shot down his plane killing him.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_3701_NAME;Oil Embargo against Japan;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_3701_DESC;In July 1941, the U.S. threatened Japan with an oil embargo unless Japan withdrew from China. Rather than withdraw from China and abandon its imperialist aspirations, Japan chose to attack the U.S. while it still had the oil reserves needed to wage war. Although the U.S. was also pursuing various deterrence strategies against Japan, the threat of an oil embargo was a more ambitious strategy of coercive diplomacy. The threat of embargo was intended not to deter Japan from taking some considered action, but to compel them to withdraw from a current activity. There were a number of reasons why coercive diplomacy not only failed, but actually provoked war in this case. First, U.S. officials failed to recognize that Japan had more at stake in the matter than did the U.S. As the situation progressed, the U.S. sharpened its demands, which in turn sharpened Japan's resistance. Second, the U.S. strategy relied almost entirely on threats, and made very little use of incentives. This left Japan to choose among almost equally unacceptable options. Finally, misperceptions, miscalculations and ambiguous signals between the U.S. and Japan contributed to the escalation of the conflict.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_3406_DESC;In Nov 1945, a British move to put the soldiers of the INA on trial sparked off a massive demonstration. Even more significant was the probable link between the INA and the wave dissatisfaction in the British Indian Army during 1945-46 which resulted in the great Bombay Naval strike. Thus between 1942  and 1946, the foundation of British power in India was badly shaken. The Quit India movement had manifested the strong anti-British feeling of the Indian people. The Indian Army, Navy and the Airforce were the three strong pillars on which the British rule in India had rested for years. Even these forces were now displaying an anti-British sentiment. All these events convinced the British Rulers that they would not be able to hold India for long. The end of British imperialism was now clearly in sight. Although England emerged victorious in World War II, it no longer remained a powerful nation and lost its absolute power in the world scenario. In a general election held in England, Churchill was replaced by Clement Atlee. Prime minister Atlee announced his intention to grant independence to India.

Some spoke, in fact, of une Europe allemande, a Europe dominated by Germany. P�tain and his ministers thought that France, as a colonial power and a major influence on Europe between the wars, would be well placed to become an important ally to this powerful nation in the heart of a new European order, un nouveau ordre europ�en. A strong government - L'�tat fran�ais, the French State, was created on 12 July 1940 - and some form of cooperation with Germany would be a necessary precondition for this.;;;;;;;;;;X

ETH_DESC;In 17th century the royal central power lost more and more of its influence so that Ethiopia broke into seperate provinces in 18th century. Only in 1853 could Ras Kasa restore the country's unity with a strong central government again and climbed the throne in 1855 as Theodor II (till 1868). However, his attempt to reform state and church after the pattern of European countries failed. After 1885 Ethiopia was endangered by the Mahdi Uprising against the British-Egyptian rule in Sudan, but the Mahdi warriors were repelled. New danger arose around 1895 through Italy and her attempts to build a colonial empire on the Horn of Africa. With the victory of Emperor Menelik II over an Italian expeditionary corps near Adua in 1896 Ethiopia was the only African country besides Liberia to keep its independence during the Age of Imperialism. Domestically, Menelik II attempted a reform of the state administration and founded the new capital of Addis Abeba.With the aid of Great Britain Ras Tafari Makonnen took the rule in 1916 and was proclaimed king in 1928. After the death of Empress Zauditu in 1930 he was crowned Emperor Haile Selassie I. In the following years he attempted to turn Ethiopia, since 1930 member of the Peoples' League, into a modern country. In 1935 Fascist Italy renewed her attempts of turning Ethiopia into her colony and invaded the country;;;;;;;;;;X

EST_DESC;Occupied by German troops during World War 1, the Russian February Revolution 1917 released powers vying for independence in Estonia. A national council was established, declaring - with German support - independence in 1918. The upper class, friendly towards the Germans, at first attempted to make the country part of Germany, but they were overruled in favor of the republic in 1919. The Soviet Union recognized the young state officially in 1920. The big landowners, sympathetic as they were towards Germany, were dispossessed. The republic's stability was proved in during the Bolshevik attempt at a coup d'etat in 1924. Only with the beginning of the Great Depression in 1929 the harmonious development was disrupted by the rise of the fascist 'Front Fighters League'. Prime Minister Konstantin P�ts, in power a number of times, reacted to the threat from the political right with the initiation of a dictatorial rule in 1934. In the same year, the Baltic Entente was formed with Latvia and Lithuania.;;;;;;;;;;x

ENG_DESC;The British Empire emerged from the 1914-1918 Great War larger than ever before, but the comfortable political and economic assurances of the Victorian era were gone for good. While Britain�s relative industrial strength continued its slow decline, the Empire�s security was threatened both internally by indigenous nationalist pressures, and externally by the resurgence of militant dictatorial powers like Italy, Germany, and Japan. At the same time, the Treasury�s demands for austerity in the midst of worldwide economic turmoil meant cutting defense expenditure to the bone, with the overstretched imperial armed services consequently unable to provide satisfactory coverage east as well as west of Suez. Diplomatically, the UK had staked much on the arbitration powers of the League of Nations, but the League�s ineffectiveness in Manchuria in 1931 augured ill for its future authority. While still committed to its alliance with France and sensitive to the traditional balancing of power in continental Europe, Britain in 1936 is a nation with many roles but a dwindling resource base with which to accomplish them.;;;;;;;;;;X
ENG_41_DESC;When the British Empire declared war on Germany in September 1939, its  people expected the general course of events to go the same way as the  Great War twenty years earlier. A small expeditionary force was sent to  France, the Royal Navy took up its blockading position athwart Germany's  sea lines of communication, and the country awaited the inevitable German  assault against the West. Initially, nothing happened. Indeed, for over six  months scarcely any fighting took place between the combatant powers, and  Britain settled into the welcome leisure of the 'Twilight War'. Then, in  May 1940, Germany's surprise Blitzkrieg offensive against France and the  Low Countries shattered this unnatural calm for good. British forces were  rudely ejected from the European mainland, France fell, and the United  Kingdom suddenly found itself alone and facing the possibility of imminent  invasion. However, a heroic air defense that summer forestalled Hitler's  'Operation Sealion' attack, and by the spring of 1941 German attentions had  switched east. The end of 1941 finds Britain in a difficult situation. The  entry of the Soviet Union and the United States into the war has provided  desperately needed allies in the struggle against Germany. However, British forces are in peril in North Africa and South East Asia, the U-Boat packs are threatening the UK's vital supply links, and a 'Second Front' in Europe seems years away. Will combined American, British and Soviet power be enough to push back the Axis?;;;;;;;;;;x

ECU_DESC;Ecuador suffered a bumpy development after her independence in 1809. Border incertainties led to conflicts with Peru and Colombia while the rivaling oligarchies of the conservative big landowners in the high lands and the liberal populace on the coast fought each other bitterly. A first era of relative peace was achieved under the dictatorship of the church friendly conservative President Gabriel Garcia Moreno who expanded central administration, the educational system, and the infrastructure. In 1875 Moreno was assassinated, which brought about a time of domestic turmoil once more till the liberals under General Eloy Alfaro prevailed. He forced the expansion of the traffic network and restricted church influence. The good economic development, focusing on the increased growing of cocoa and coffee ended with the Great Depression 1929/30, destabilizing Ecuador's domestic situation again. A border conflict with Colombia was settled in 1931.;;;;;;;;;;x

DOM_DESC;In 1844 the Eastern part of the island of Hispaniola, since 1822 a part of the young country Haiti, declared its independence as Dominican Republic. Instability and foreign threats marked the early years of the new state. Restorative tendencies found the support of the oligarchy who, in the face of a border dispute with Haiti, put the country back under Spanish colonial rule in 1861 until revolts forced independence again in 1865. Economically and politcally the Dominican Republic became more and more dependant on the U.S.A. who first openly intervened in 1905 to collect debts. Between 1916 and 1924 they occupied the country in order to get control over the financial and military institutions, beginning a democratization of the state. The miltary coup of General Rafael L�onidas Trujillo y Molina in 1930 abolished the 1924 constitution again. He went a forceful way to modernize and centralize the country, not looking at the social havoc this caused.;;;;;;;;;;x

DEN_DESC;The Danish defeat in the 2nd German-Danish War of 1864 after which Denmark had to cede Schleswig-Holstein and Oldenburg to Prussia and Austria led to the country's withdrawal into neutrality and to a pressure for reforms within. Already since 1849 Denmark had been a constitutional monarchy. Liberals and Social Democrats begun strengthening the parliament starting 1901. Economically, Denmark focused on expanding its agriculture which became the most important part of their exports. During World War 1 (1914 - 1918) the country remained neutral and continued the democratization process, introducing a democratic constitution in 1915.The primarily Social Democratic governments after The Great War layed the foundations for a welfare state that was patterned after the example of Sweden and up till today secures the population one of the highest standards of living in the world. The foreign politics of Denmark marked several successes. In 1920 Northern Slesvig was re-integrated into the country after a referendum had been held by rule of the Versailles Peace Treaty. In 1933 the International Court in Den Haag decided a case between Norway and Denmark over the owbership of Greenland in favor of the Danish. However, the Germans had keen eyes on the country as it is strategically important in both controlling access to the Baltic Sea and the shipping of ore from Scandinavia.;;;;;;;;;;x

CZE_DESC;After the outbreak of World War One Czech philosopher Thom�s Garrigue Masaryk (1850 - 1937) and his close confidant Eduard Benes (1884 - 1948) worked for an independent state. With representatives of Slovakian immigrants in the U.S. they signed the Pittsburgh Treaty in May 1918, agreeing on the union of Czechs and Slovaks in a state to be founded. 1918, shortly before the military defeat of Austria-Hungary and Germany independent Czechoslovakia was proclaimed in Prague. Masaryk was elected first president (1918 - 1935). However, the young country suffered from two shortcomings. For one, the relationship between Czechs and Slovaks who had lived for centuries under Hungarian rule proved to be difficult. The Slovak part of the country was mainly agriculturally oriented, and its citizens felt to be at a disadvantage against their Czech countrymen. For another, over three million Germans (Sudetendeutsche) lived in the new republic and only reluctantly acknowledged the Czech dominated state power. The government in Prague, however, despite proclaiming other intent, lacked tact and will of integration in their policies towards the minority. Despite those difficulties a working parliamentary system formed after 1920 with a broad array of political parties. Since 1926 members of the most important minorities (Germans, Hungarians) had representatives in the government. However, export-oriented as the areas with Sudeten Germans were, those regions were hardest hit by the Great Depression 1929/30 and more national tensions were the consequence. After Hitler's rise to power in Germany in 1933 the Sudeten German party SdP became more and more an instrument of Nazi expansionism and it would only be a matter of time till Adolf Hitler would face the young Czechoslovakian republic with territorial claims.;;;;;;;;;;x

CUB_DESC;The explosion of the U.S. warship Maine in the port of Havana in 1898 gave the U.S.A. the opportunity to declare war on Spain, colonial masters of the Carribean island. In the Peace of Paris 1898 Spain had to cede Cuba, along with the Phillipines and Puerto Rico to the United States who in turn put the island under military administration. Formally, independence was declared in 1900, but the Platt-Amendment of 1901 restricted the autonomy again, giving the U.S. the naval bases of Bahia Honda and Guantanamo in addition to the right to intervene in the case of internal unrest. In 1902 the United States withdrew from the island, leaving the government of the first Cuban president, Tom�s Estrada Palma in charge. However, already in 1906 - 1909 the U.S. intervened on the grounds of the Platt-Amendment when the liberals campaigned against President Estrada Palma. Further interventions took place in 1912 and between 1917 and 1919. In 1922 the last American soldiers left the island. U.S. investment, especially in sugarcane plantations, brought Cuba a quick econoimic rise. Nevertheless, the country came into economic dependency of the U.S. and her imports of tobacco and sugar. The agricultural monoculture was prone to crisis which led to economic disaster during the Great Depression 1929/30. impovering large parts of the population. Dictatorial measures taken by President Gerardo Machaldo y Porales (1925 - 1933) were answered by a military coup. Former sergeant and private secretary of Machado, Fulgencio Batista y Zaldivar held the reigns in his position of leader of that revolution and supreme commander of the army. He pushed through the appointment of Carlos Mendieta Montefur as president and achieved the lifting of the Platt-Amendment in 1934. Through the army Batista controlled the government, becoming president in 1940, and installing a dictatorial regime.;;;;;;;;;;x

COS_DESC;Costa Rica differed in several ways from other countries in Middle America. Because of the largely white population there were no racial conflicts. Farming was dominated by family businesses owned by a broad middle class offering little fuel for a clash of social interests. Politically, however, influencial and rivaling families called the tune and even resorted to military action to achieve their goals. Sugar and coffee were important export goods, but bananas were the most important one for which a tight railroad was built, improving the economical growth of Costa Rica. The bananas production came slowly under complete control of U.S. businesses (among others United Fruit). Parallel to this, Costa Rica witnessed a calm democratic development with presidents elected in constitutional elections. This period was only interrupted by the short dictatorship of Frederico Tinoco Granodos (1917 - 1919).;;;;;;;;;;x

COL_DESC;Weakened by civil wars (especially 1899 - 1903), Colombia had to acknowledge U.S. rights of control of the Panama Canal in the Hay-Bunan-Varilla Treaty of 1903, ending the conflict between the two countries about the building of the Canal. When the Colombian Congress denied to ratify the treaty the United States forced the secession of Panama from Colombia, compensating them between 1921 and 1930 with a payment of a total 25 million Dollars. Colombia formally recognized Panama in 1921. The conservatives pursued the modernization of the country, expanding the railrod network. Since 1850 Colombia had been exporting tobacco, after 1900 coffee and bananas were added (with the aid of U.S. capital), after 1905 petroleum. The Great Depression brought the liberals into government in 1930 who enacted a land reform, dispossessing big landowners, and social reforms, easing the consequences of the economic crisis for the middle class, the workers' class and the peasants.;;;;;;;;;;x

CHL_DESC;After the Saltpeter War 1879 - 1883 in which Chile received the Peruvian saltpeter provinces Tarapac� and Arica in addition to the Bolivian coastal region of Antofagasta the country had command over vast copper deposits and monopolized the world trade in saltpeter. A phase of economic prosperity was initiated, supported by the high demand for saltpeter at the beginning of World War One. However, the chemical processes devised during that war to artificially produce saltpeter rendered Chile's deposits worthless. Worsening economic circumstances, together with the growth of the population increased social crisis. Workers and unions gained political influence. President Arturo Alessandri y Palma (1920 -1925, 1932 - 1938) tried to overcome the social tensions. A new constitution expanded the president's powers at the cost of the congress' authority. After the military dictatorship of Carlos Ibanez del Campo (1927 -1931) fell under the pressure of the Great Depression the country slowly recovered from the recession.;;;;;;;;;;x

CHI_DESC;The early 1930's were both good times and bad times for Nationalist China. On the one hand, the Guomindang regime under Chiang Kai-Shek was at the peak of it's power, having driven Mao Tse-tung's Communists on their grueling 6,000 mile march to Shaanxi and established themselves as the most powerful force in Chinese politics. It seemed that China was at last united under a stable, modernizing regime, ready to bring the country into the 20th century after years of humiliation at the hands of stronger countries. However, it faced a severe challenge: an increasingly belligerent and imperialist Japan desiring to expand it's resource base at China's expense. Having already conceded control of Manchuria to the Japanese in 1931, China seems destined for further clashes with the island nation, yet in early 1936 Chiang shows no signs of letting up in his civil war against the Communists. The question China must now face is a sore one: when and if Japan continues her expansion, will the Nationalists fight, or will China be humiliated yet again? ;;;;;;;;;;X

BUL_DESC;After the preliminary peace of San Stefano in the 8th Russian-Turkish War 1877/78, the newly formed national state of Bulgaria included Macedonia to the Ochrid Lake and a coastal strip on the Aegean Sea. The Berlin Congress 1878, however, limited the country's terriory to the region between Danube and Balkans. Macedonia and Eastern Rumelia remained with the Ottoman Empire. Russia, interested in controlling Bulgaria, watched the successes of Prince Alexander I (annexion of Eastern Rumelia in 1885 and the victory over Serbia in 1885/86) with distrust. They forced Alexander I to abdicate after a coup led by pro-Russian officers. His successor became Ferdinand of Saxony-Coburg-Gotha. He achieved the formal independence from the Ottomans and was crwned Czar in 1908. With the idea of a Greater Bulgaria as a vision the country became the driving force in the Balkans League and carried the main burden in the First Balkans War (1912/13). Bulgaria suffered defeat from a coalition of Greece, Serbia, Montenegro, Romania, and the Ottoman Empire during the Second Balkans War 1913 in which Bulgaria had planned to devour parts of the Balkans now free from the Turks. In the peace of Bucharest, they lostlarge parts of the gains from the First Balkans War - Southern Dobrudja went to Romania, and Adrianople went to the Ottomans. Of Macedonia which Bulgaria had demanded as a whole they only managed to hold onto a small strip in the Pirin Mountains, the rest was parted between Serbia and Greece. In 1915 Bulgaria joined the Middle Powers and occupied the territories she sought to take for herself. After the Entente's victory the country lost its conquests in the Peace of Neuilly 1919, plus the access to the Aegean Sea as Greece was awarded Southern Thrace. Ferdinand I abdiacted in 1918 in favor of his son Boris III. Prime Minister Alexander Stambuliski (1919 - 1923), leader of the radical Farmers' Party enacted a land reform and supported the Balkans Federation until he was killed in a military coup in 1923.

BRA_DESC;After slavery was abolished in 1888, the republicans gained much support from all parts of the Brazilian Empire. In 1889 the revolt began with a revolt of the military garrison and ended with the declaration of the Republic of Brazil. The 1891 constitution was patterned after the U.S. constitution, granting considerable autonomies to the respective provinces. Under the first elected presidents the domestic situation stabilized, but Brazil got into the cycle of economic crisis - Sugar Crisis 1890, Coffee Crisis 1896, end of the rubber boom 1913. Meanwhile, Brazil's foreign minister, Baron Do Rio Branco extended the Brazilian territory through a series of treaties with British-Guyana, Columbia, Bolivia, Peru, and Uruguay the country's territory by over 250,000 square miles. Growing industries and a high influx of immigrants led to a strong industrial proletariat, changing the society of Brazil. The flourishing exports after World War One came to an end with the Great Depression of 1929/30, especially when the prices for coffee and rubber plummeted. A movement of social reformist officers called 'Tenentismo' took advantage of the situation, supporting the revolution of Get�lio Dornelles Vargas who established an authoritarian rule with strong presidential powers and highly reduced autonomies of the federal states, turning Brazil into a dictatorship by and by.;;;;;;;;;;x

BOL_DESC;In foreign politics Bolivia suffered hurtful losses. A border conflict with Chile led to the Saltpeter War 1879 - 1883 which Bolivia lost despite an alliance with Peru. Having to cede the coastal province of Antofagasta in the peace treaty of Valparaiso 1884, the country lost its access to the sea. In 1903 Brazil and Bolivia signed the Treaty of P�troplis, granting Brazil the important rubber province Acre. A sum of 2 million Pound Sterling didn't compensate the loss. Attempting to secure access to a port in the Chaco War with Paraguay (1932 - 1935) caused the loss of the larger part of the Chaco Boreal region, but at least secured aceess to the Paraguay river leading to the Atlantic Ocean (finalized in the Treaty of Buenos Aires 1938). Chaco War and the Great Depression brought an end to the positive economic development since 1895 when tin became main export good. In the face of protest movements of the middle class and the mine workes military governments with state socialist tendencies took over.;;;;;;;;;;x

BHU_DESC;In 17th century the Lama Ngawang Namgyal who had fled Tibet managed to unify the country and to secure his further conquests through the building of monastery fortresses (Dzongs). The first spiritual and secular ruler of Bhuatan, called Shabdung, helped the Drupka Sect to win and transfered the Tibetan governmental system of Dalai Lamas to Bhutan. The Drukpas (Druk = Dragon) gave the country its name - Dragon Land (Druk Yul). The succession of the ruler based on reincarnation. Shabdung Namgyal supposedly seperated the country into three regions which were ruled by princes (Penlop). In 19th century only two of the three houses still were of importance - the Tsonga-Penlops east of the Black Mountains under the Wangchuk family and the Paro-Penlops who govrned almost all of western Bhutan. With the election of the Penlop of Tsonga, Ugyen Wangchuk, on december 17th, 1907, as the first Druk Gyalpo (Dragon king) the Shabdung system was replaced by a hereditary monarchy.Externally, Bhutan came into conflict with the expanding British East India Company who drove the Bhutanese out of the Indian regions of Cooch Behar between 1772 and 1774. 1864/65 Bhutan lost claims to parts of the Bengal and Siamese Plains during the Second British-Bhutanese War. In the Treaty of Punakha 1910 Bhutan formally became a British Protectorate but retianed its internal autonomy.;;;;;;;;;;X

AUS_DESC;After World War One Austria had been reduced to its German core land. On November 12th, 1918, the republic was proclaimed. The provisorical national assembly created a preliminary constitution and appointed a coalition government under the social democrat Karl Renner (1919/20), replacing the previous majory vote system by a system of proportional representation, including suffrage for women. Goal of national assembly and government was the unification with Germany, made impossible, however, by decisions of the war's victors. A constitution declaring Austria a federal state was installed in 1920. In the election held thereafter, the social democrats lost to the conservative Christian Socials who would become the dominating power in Austrian politics in the following years. Their governments, however, didn't succeed in stabilizing the young republic. Before the background of great economic problems the society drifted to the radical lefts (Republican Protection League) and rights (Heimwehr). Several times Austria was on the brink of civil war. A change of the constitution in 1929 to strengthen the role of the president was designed to further stabilize the country. In the early 1930s the Nazis gained support in Austria, too. Conservative Chancellor Engelbert Dollfu� took the Nazi's successes as an opportunity to abolish the constitution and erect an authoritarian regime. After unrests in 1934 Dollfu� banned all parties except his own Vaterl�ndische Front and installed a constitution after fascist rolemodels. He was killed, however, during a coup attempt on July 25th, 1934. His successor, Karl Schuschnigg continued his policy, seeking to settle tensions with Germany and to protect Austria's sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;x

AST_DESC;The Commonwealth of Australia was formally granted independence on Jan. 1st 1901, joining the British Commonwealth and becoming a staunch ally of Britain. Its fortunes since that time have been mixed, while its economy has grown steadily since independence, it suffered heavy losses during the Great War, suffering the greatest casualties in proportion to total number of troops involved of any of the Allies during the war. Nevertheless, it was through the Great War that the ANZAC (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) won a reputation for outstanding bravery surpassed by none, serving with distinction in Palestine and Flanders, while forever embedding the peninsula of Gallipoli in Australian folklore. The boom period of the 1920's ended with disaster as the Great Depression ruined Australia's economy and, at its worst, put up to a third of the country's workers out of a job. By 1936, theAustralian economy is still suffering from the depression, and Australia is by no means ready for war. Yet, should war come, no one doubts they will continue to stand by Britain.;;;;;;;;;;x
AST_41_DESC;By December 1941, Australia has been at war for over two years, and Australians have fought in first Greece, then Crete, and finally North Africa alongside their Commonwealth allies, where the Anzacs are currently battling Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps. Yet, with the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7th and the following Japanese push for expansion into the south Pacific, Australia seems to be in a difficult position. If the Japanese attacks are successful, the Australian mainland could be in danger for the first time in the war, and at the moment Japan's strike south is going very well, with the first obstacles being overcome on the Malayan peninsula and Britain's navy in the Far East effectively crippled with the loss of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse to Japanese bombers. Australia's critical hour appears to be upon her, and the question of withdrawing troops from North Africa to bolster the mainland's defence is thus being seriously considered.;;;;;;;;;;x

Yet, despite continued economic problems and a lack of enthusiasm spawned from memories of the Great War, Australia entered the war against Germany on September 3rd 1939 without hesitation. With the world at war again and a new generation ready to fight it, the question remains whether the Anzacs will continue to uphold their reputation as a fighting force equal to any in the world.;;;;;;;;;;x

ARG_DESC;In 1880 Argentina owned large areas suitable for their prime agricultural products: cattle and wheat. More workers were needed, increasing the numbe of immigrants. Financial capital, however, was largely controlled by the British who invested in infrastructure, controlled most banks and trade businesses, and that capital soon made Argentina the leading exporter of beef and wheat in the world. In the wake of this development an urban middle class formed as well as an industrial workers' class. Both called for more representation in politics to be achieved through changes to the electorial system. The radical UCR (Uni�n Civica Radical), founded in 1889, fought for those goals and came strong out of the reform of the electorial system which the conservative president Roque S�enz Pena pushed through in 1912. In 1916 the first universal elections were held in which Hip�lito Irigoyen of the UCR won. For the first time the middle classes had politcal influence. In foreign politics Argentina steered a course of neutrality while social legislature was to take away some negative effects of the wave of industrialization in the country. The period of economic rise and the second presidence of Irigoyen was ended abruptly with the Great Depression 1929/30. Conservative politicians and generals claimed the presidency after a military coup, but none of them could overcome the social tensions.;;;;;;;;;;x

ALL_F_MISSTACT;Killing all natives in a province will help in colonization attempts as will the presence of your own troops. The required 150-200 colonists that you will need to send will cost you somewhere between 15.000 and 20.000$ so make sure to build a solid economy by increasing infrastructure and trade levels and acquiring a monopoly in your center of trade. Remember the cheap traders will generate just as much wealth in a center of trade as the by far more expensive colonies! On the other hand tax incomes from the provinces where you build cities will be your most valuable asset. Watch out for inflation if you run across a gold mine ? inflation can only be reduced by going bankrupt...;;;;;;;;;;X

ALL_F_HISTDESC;The 2500$ you start with will last for a while but when its gone you'll need to have a decent economy in place not just low-level colonies. Try to establish one or preferably two cities early on by sending colonists there. Don't be afraid to take loans or even go bankrupt just keep in mind that the effects of a bankruptcy (higher interest rates for new loans lower troop morale) last for five years. Beware of natives!

ALB_DESC;In 15th century, Albanian national hero Skanderbeg fought back the Turkish invaders. After his death however and the fall of Krujas and Shkodra the country came under four centuries of foreign rule. Large numbers of the population converted to Islam in the 16th and 17th century, allowing them to rise into the highest offices - eleven Grand Veziers came from Albania, and Mohammed Ali founded a dynasty in Egypt 1805. The Islamization brought support for the resistance against Serbs and Greek as well as against the Ottoman rule itself. Only at the end of the 19th century the national renaissance began with the founding of the League of Prizren. During the First Balkans War in 1912 the Albanian national congress in Vlore declared the country's independence which was accepted by the major powers in 1913 upon the condition that Wilhelms of Wied would be accepted as Prince. The short lived Principality Albania was occupied by the Middle Powers during World War One before it was conquered by Italy. After the war the leader of the Democratic Party, Bishop Fan Noli, faced the ruling conservatives under Ahmed Zogu. After a democratic interlude in 1924, Zogu eventually prevailed with aid from Yugoslavia and White Guards from Russia. He became president in 1925 and proclaimed himself king in 1928.;;;;;;;;;;x

AFG_DESC;Afghanistan was always a troubled region for the British to maintain control of. An important part of the 'Great Game' between the British Empire and the Russian Czars during the 19th century, every attempt to fully subdue the country ran into fierce resistance. By 1880, however, after the Second Anglo-Afghan war, the emir of Afghanistan finally agreed to allow British control over the country's foreign affairs. But following the Great War, the Afghani emir was assassinated and his son launched yet another war against Britain until the war-weary British agreed to fully withdraw from the country. By 1921 a cease-fire was finally signed granting Afghanistan complete independence. By 1923, a constitution was drawn up and the long process of modernization began....perhaps a bit too quickly. The newly crowned King was deposed by a revolt from Afghani tribesman angry at his attempts to do away with centuries old traditions, forcing him into exile by the end of the 1920's. He was replaced by King Nadir Shah, who kept his continuing reforms to a more acceptable pace. By 1936, Nadir Shah has been assassinated and his son has inherited the throne, but despite lingering resentments among tribal leaders there is no sign of turmoil for the country in the immediate future.;;;;;;;;;;x
